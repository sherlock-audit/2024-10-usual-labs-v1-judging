# Incorrect Fee Calculation in withdraw Leads to Undercharging and Mismanagement of $.totalDeposits

### Summary

The withdraw function incorrectly deducts fees from `totalDeposits` by recalculating the fee by the asset value provided by the user, instead of calculating Fee on AssetWithoutFee. This results in the protocol undercharging the withdrawal fee and reducing totalDeposits by a lower amount than intended. Over time, this discrepancy can cause financial imbalances, reducing the protocolâ€™s revenue and impacting its ability to maintain accurate accounting and yield distribution.

The `maxWithdraw`, `PreviewRedeem`, `previewWithdraw` are override by the contract and executing there logic, the issue is occurring on fee calculation( explained in POC ). the correct calculation in done in redeem function.

```solidity 
 function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
        public
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        YieldDataStorage storage yieldStorage = _getYieldDataStorage();

        // Check withdrawal limit
        uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
        }
        // Calculate shares needed
        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

        // Perform withdrawal (exact assets to receiver)
        super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);

        // take the fee
        yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
    }
```

### Root Cause

_Wrong Fee calculation_
```solidity
     uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
```
The fee is calculated twice using different asset values:
First Fee (Correct): Calculated on assetsWithoutFee in previewRedeem.
Second Fee (Incorrect): Calculated again in withdraw by passing assets parameter.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Undercharged Fee: The protocol collects fewer fees than intended, potentially leading to financial losses hence generating less revenue.

### PoC

lets address the issue with the example :- 
1. `totalDeposit` = 1000 and `totalShares` = 1000, for simplicity lets use this value ( and ignore the yeild)
2. withdrawFeeBps = 2500 basis_points 
3. Suppose userA hold 50% of the system = which means 500 shares 
4. As `PreviewRedeem` return asset after deducting the fee From it, so user need to provide `Asset parameter with - fee` from it, otherwise function will revert
5. `lets calculate fee =
            Math.mulDiv(assetsWithoutFee, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
        assets = assetsWithoutFee - fee;  (500 * 2500) / 10000 = 125 `
6. User call Withdraw( ) with 375 as asset, to withdraw there whole deposit
7. 375 > 375 passes L:331 if (assets > maxAssets) {
8.  Then shares are calculated on `previewWithdraw` by `Assetwithfee` which will be `asset * totalSupply/ totalAsset` = (375 + 125 * 1000) / 1000= 500 shares
9. `But on L:336 the Fee is again calculated on asset which is (375  * 2500)/ 10000 = 93.75 round ceil = 94 and being deducted which is wrong, because actual Fee is 125 which is calculated prior not 94`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L336
` uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);`

The correct implementation is performed in Redeem function where it calculated from the difference `assetWithoutFee - asset`

### Mitigation
1. Either revise the withdraw function similar to redeem
2. or let the user pass there whole asset amount, revise 1previewRedeem` function
3. or calculate the fee on asset + fee(calculated on PreviewRedeem) 375 + 125 = 500, Fee will be 500 * 2500/ 10000 = 125
`uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(asset + fee, withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);`
