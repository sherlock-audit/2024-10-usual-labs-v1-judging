# Non-Standard EIP Hash Calculation Using keccak256 and Bitwise Masking for UsualXStorageLocaion

### Summary

In the `UsualX.sol` at line 87 The provided expression involves a custom hashing and masking mechanism using keccak256, followed by a bitwise negation and AND operation. The operation first computes a keccak256 hash of the string "usualX.storage.v0", converts it into a uint256, subtracts 1, encodes it, and hashes it again using keccak256. Then, the result is masked by clearing the last byte with the operation & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff)). This specific approach deviates from common EIP standards and appears to be designed for internal contract management or unique state manipulation.

### Impact

Non-Standard Hashing: This hashing approach doesn't adhere to any recognized EIP standards (such as EIP-20, EIP-721, or others), which could lead to compatibility issues, especially when interacting with other Ethereum contracts or systems that rely on standardized hash calculations.

### PoC

To demonstrate the behavior of this custom hash function, let's show how it might be used in a smart contract:
```javascript
// Solidity PoC to demonstrate the custom EIP hash calculation
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CustomHash {
    function customHash() public pure returns (bytes32) {
        // The expression to calculate the custom EIP hash
        bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256("usualX.storage.v0")) - 1));
        return hash & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff));
    }
}
```
Steps:

1. keccak256("usualX.storage.v0"): Compute the Keccak-256 hash of the string "usualX.storage.v0".
2. uint256(keccak256(...)) - 1: Convert the result to a uint256 and subtract 1.
3. keccak256(abi.encode(...)): Re-hash the resulting uint256 value to get a final bytes32 hash.
4. & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff)): Apply a bitwise mask to clear the last byte of the hash

Expected Outcome: The final result will be the keccak256 hash of "usualX.storage.v0" minus 1, with the last byte cleared (set to 0). This is non-standard and may not match expected hash outcomes in systems using more common EIP hash patterns.

### Mitigation

Adopt Standard Hashing Methods: If possible, use standard Ethereum hashing schemes (such as keccak256 without unnecessary bitwise masking)
