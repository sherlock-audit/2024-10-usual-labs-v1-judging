# Lack of Input Validation in DistributionModule.sol

### **Summary**
I have identified a vulnerability in the provided smart contract, specifically within the setter functions `setD`, `setM0`, `setRateMin`, `setBaseGamma`, and `setBucketsDistribution`. These functions lack comprehensive validation for the input values, leading to potential security risks such as integer overflow, unexpected state changes, and violation of business logic.

### **Root Cause**
1. **Lack of Range and Boundaries Validation**:  
   The setter functions `setD`, `setM0`, `setRateMin`, and `setBaseGamma` only check for non-zero values but fail to impose restrictions on the values’ ranges. Without proper boundaries, malicious users could input extreme values that could affect calculations, breach business logic, or cause overflow.

2. **Inadequate Validation for Percentages in `setBucketsDistribution`**:  
   While the sum of percentage values is checked, the individual percentages are not validated. This oversight could allow the input of invalid percentages (e.g., negative values or values exceeding 100), potentially leading to miscalculation or unexpected behavior.

### **Internal Pre-conditions**
- The functions assume that input values are always valid, such as being non-zero for `setD`, `setM0`, `setRateMin`, `setBaseGamma`, and non-negative percentages for `setBucketsDistribution`.  
- There is no validation on the individual values of percentages within `setBucketsDistribution`, which may lead to invalid states.

### **External Pre-conditions**
- The functions rely on external actors providing valid inputs. If these assumptions are violated, the contract may exhibit unexpected behavior.
- There is no assumption that the values for `setBucketsDistribution` will be individually valid or fall within a certain threshold.

### **Attack Path**
1. **Deploy the vulnerable contract**:  
   Deploy the contract with the vulnerable setter functions (`setD`, `setM0`, `setRateMin`, `setBaseGamma`, `setBucketsDistribution`) on a test network or local environment.

2. **Exploit `setD`, `setM0`, `setRateMin`, `setBaseGamma`**:  
   An attacker could invoke any of these functions with abnormally high or low values, leading to potential integer overflow or unexpected behavior.

3. **Exploit `setBucketsDistribution`**:  
   By passing incorrect percentage values (e.g., values exceeding 100 or negative values), an attacker could corrupt the state of the contract, which may affect the overall functionality.

### **Impact**
Exploiting these vulnerabilities could result in:
- **Integer overflow or underflow**: Allowing extremely large values could overflow state variables, leading to inconsistent or incorrect contract behavior.
- **Unexpected contract behavior**: Invalid input could result in incorrect calculations or an invalid state, compromising the contract’s intended logic.
- **Corruption of business logic**: Invalid percentages could lead to incorrect distribution logic, disrupting the contract's intended functionality.

### **PoC (Proof of Concept)**
The following Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates an attack where an adversary can exploit the unchecked setter functions:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "./VulnerableContract.sol";

contract AttackVulnerableContract {
    VulnerableContract public vulnerableContract;

    uint256 public maliciousValue = 10**50; // Abnormally high value for testing

    constructor(address _vulnerableContractAddress) {
        vulnerableContract = VulnerableContract(_vulnerableContractAddress);
    }

    function attackSetD() public {
        // Assume the attacker has the necessary role
        vulnerableContract.setD(maliciousValue);
    }

    function attackSetBucketsDistribution() public {
        uint256;
        address;
        
        // Malicious input with invalid percentages
        maliciousPercentages[0] = 200; // Invalid percentage > 100
        maliciousPercentages[1] = 50;
        maliciousPercentages[2] = 30;
        
        // Assume the attacker has the necessary role
        vulnerableContract.setBucketsDistribution(maliciousPercentages, accounts);
    }
}
```

This PoC can be adapted to various testing frameworks such as Foundry, Hardhat, Truffle, or Brownie for exploitation, demonstration, and validation.

### **Mitigation**
To address these issues, I recommend adding robust input validation checks in the affected setter functions:

#### Patched Code
```solidity
function setD(uint256 _d) external {
    require(_d >= MIN_D && _d <= MAX_D, "Input out of valid range");
    // Additional logic here
}

function setBucketsDistribution(uint256[] memory _percentages, address[] memory _accounts) external {
    require(_percentages.length > 0, "Percentages array cannot be empty");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _percentages.length; i++) {
        require(_percentages[i] >= 0 && _percentages[i] <= 100, "Invalid percentage value");
    }
    // Additional logic here
}
```

#### Explanation of the Fix
- **Range Checks for `setD`**: Implements checks to ensure that `_d` is within a valid range defined by constants like `MIN_D` and `MAX_D`.
- **Validation for `setBucketsDistribution`**: Adds checks to ensure each percentage is valid and falls within a proper range (0-100%).

### **Conclusion**
By implementing these validation checks, the smart contract will be protected against unwanted behavior and security risks, leading to better stability and reliability. The absence of proper input checks can lead to misuse and manipulation, which can be prevented by enforcing stricter validation logic across all setter functions.
