### Attack Path

When users claim their vested airdrop tokens via the `AirdropDistribution.claim` function, the `AirdropDistribution.penalty()` function will be executed to compute the penalty amount for a given amount.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L190

```solidity
File: AirdropDistribution.sol
184:     /// @notice Computes the penalty amount for the given account.
185:     /// @param $ The storage struct of the contract.
186:     /// @param totalAmount Total amount claimable by the user.
187:     /// @param account Address of the account.
188:     /// @param monthsPassed Number of months passed since the start of the vesting period.
189:     /// @return The penalty amount.
190:     function _computePenalty(
191:         AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $,
192:         uint256 totalAmount,
193:         address account,
194:         uint256 monthsPassed
195:     ) internal returns (uint256) {
```

The penalty will be deducted from the user's claimable amount. Thus, if the user's total vested USUAL tokens is 10000, but the penalty is 3000, users will only receive 7000 USUAL. The remaining 3000 USUAL will reside within the `AirdropDistribution` contract.

However, the issue is that there is no way for the protocol or the admin to retrieve the 3000 USUAL collected as penalty. Thus, they are stuck in the contract.

> Per the Contest's README, it was a known issue that withdrawal fees would be stuck within the `UsualX` contract. However, this issue is related to the penalty being stuck in `AirdropDistribution` contract, not the `UsualX` contract. Thus, it is a different contract, and this issue is technically not a known issue in the context of this audit contest if the rules are followed strictly during the judging.

> > We are choosing to not be able to withdraw fees on UsualX for the time being. At the moment, the fees wouldn't be withdrawable. This is a deliberate choice to be implemented in a later contract upgrade, when the protocol governance decides on how the unstaking fees should be dealt with (i.e. burned, redistributed).

### Impact

USUAL tokens stuck in the `AirdropDistribution` contract. No one can collect the USUAL tokens collected from the users as a penalty.

Severity: High. Assets stuck in contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a function to retrieve the penalty fee OR document this issue as one of the known issues.
