# `UsualSP::totalStaked()` doesn't account for total original allocation in calculation which leads to stuck rewards

### Summary

In `UsualSP` contract user's can stake tokens to earn rewards. The rewards are calculated based on user's `balanceOf`. `balanceOf` accounts for user's `liquidAllocation` and `originalAllocation`. `originalAllocation` is set by the admin and it increases user's `balanceOf` which results in bigger rewards. However, there is a problem with `totalStaked` function. `totalStaked` function is used to calculate `_rewardPerToken` which calculates current reward per token staked.

The issue is that `totalStaked` function doesn't account for `originalAllocation` for all users which leads to incorrect `rewardPerTokenStored` calculation.

### Root Cause

`balanceOf` accounts for `liquidAllocation` and `originalAllocation`.

`totalStaked` doesn't account for total `originalAllocation`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin must set `originalAllocation` for any user.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Incorrect rewards calculation will allows user's with `originalAllocation` to claim tokens that were meant for other users. In extreme scenario rewards can be permanently stuck in staking contract. Users can lose 100% of their rewards.

### PoC

Let's assume this scenario:

1. Protocol wants to distribute `200` tokens. Duration is set to `100` seconds.
2. Alice has staked `100` tokens and has `100` `originalAllocation`.
3. Bob has staked `100` tokens and has `0` `originalAllocation`.
4. With current `totalStaked` is eqaul to `200`. Alice's `balanceOf` is `200`. Bob's `balanceOf` is equal to `100`.
5. Alice claims rewards.

RewardRate = 200/100 = 2 tokens per second.
Duration is equal to 100.
Alice's `balanceOf` is equal to 200.
Total staked = 200.

Alice earned = 200 * 100 * 2 / 200 = 200 which is the total rewards amount

6. Bob tries to claim rewards but there are no more rewards to claim, transaction reverts.

### Mitigation

To fix the rewards calculation the protocol can add `originalAllocation` to `UsualSP` contract address to increase it's `balanceOf`.

```diff
function allocate(
        address[] calldata recipients,
        uint256[] calldata originalAllocations,
        uint256[] calldata cliffDurations
    ) external {
        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE);

        if (
            recipients.length != originalAllocations.length
                || recipients.length != cliffDurations.length || recipients.length == 0
        ) {
            revert InvalidInputArraysLength();
        }

        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
            if (cliffDurations[i] > $.duration) {
                revert CliffBiggerThanDuration();
            }
            if (recipients[i] == address(0)) {
                revert InvalidInput();
            }

            if (originalAllocations[i] < $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]]) {
                revert CannotReduceAllocation();
            }

            _updateReward(recipients[i]);

++          $.originalAllocation[address(this)] = originalAllocations[i];
            $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = originalAllocations[i];
            $.cliffDuration[recipients[i]] = cliffDurations[i];

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        emit NewAllocation(recipients, originalAllocations, cliffDurations);
    }
```

Also fix the `removeOriginalAllocation` function accordingly.
