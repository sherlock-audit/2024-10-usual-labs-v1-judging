# Incorrect fee calculation in the `UsualX::withdraw()` will lead to the protocol losing fees

### Summary

Incorrect fee calculation in `UsualX::withdraw()` will cause loss of funds for the protocol because the fees are not accounted/calculated correctly. Additionally, it might also lead to funds being locked in the vault. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L319

`UsualX::withdraw()` function allows users to withdraw the assets they transferred into the vault. The protocol charges a fee that is set in the `UsualXStorageV0` as `withdrawFeeBps`. 
 
A point of interest in the function is given below: 
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
    ...
        uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
        }
    ...
```

The function calculates the `maxAssets` a user is allowed to withdraw from the vault taking into considering the protocol's fee. This is done through the function `UsualX::maxWithdraw()`.
The main error of the code is in the following snippet: 
```solidity
...
        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
...
```
The `fee` calculated in the function takes the user supplied `uint256 assets` which already subtracts the protocol fee. This causes the fee calculation to never be the correct amount given by the equation: `assets * fee / 100` because the user supplied `assets` will never reach the full amount deposited into the vault.

### Attack Path

For example,
1. A user deposits `100 ether` into the vault. 
2. Lets consider that the fee is set to `5%`. The max amount they can withdraw is `95 ether` after calculating the fees because the function `withdraw` will revert for withdrawal amounts more than `95 ether`. 
3. When the user calls the `withdraw` function, it will calculate the fee on the `95 ether` withdrawal requested by the user.
4. Hence, the total fee is `4.75 ether` instead of the correct `5 ether`. 
5. The user in this scenario gets `95 ether`. 

A more interesting case is when a user withdraws multiple times: 
* A user deposits `100 ether` into the vault. 
* Considering a fee of `5%`. The user withdraws `50 ether`. 
* The vault takes a fee of `5% * 50 = 2.5 ether`. 
* The user should have `45 ether` left to withdraw. But, since only `4.75%` of the fee was subtracted. The new `maxWithdraw` is `(100 ether - 52.5 ether) * 4.75% = 45.125 ether`. 
* The user in this case gets to withdraw `95.125 ether` if they withdraw in multiple transactions. 

So, the more withdrawals a user makes, the lower they have to pay in fees until the fees reach a lower limit given by the equation: `fee * (100 - fee)/100`. 

When a user withdraws their assets in a single transaction, the fee charged will be the amount set by the protocol. But, the difference in tokens between `fee` and `fee * (100 - fee)/100` (for example `5% - 4.75% = 0.25%`) is stored in the vault as excess tokens. This might also lead to funds being locked in the vault. 

### Impact

The protocol does not earn the `withdrawFeeBps` as expected. Instead it makes `fee * (100 - fee)/100` percent of fees. 

For example: for a `5% withdrawFeeBps`, the protocol will only earn `4.75%`. 

This may lead to millions of dollars in damages. 

### PoC

The following test should be added into the `UsualXIntegration.t.sol`: 

```solidity
function test_fees_for_withdraw() public {
        uint256 depositAmount = 100e18;
        uint256 withdrawAmount = 95e18;

        // Initial deposit
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        usualToken.mint(alice, depositAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        usualToken.approve(address(usualX), depositAmount);
        usualX.deposit(depositAmount, alice);
        // when alice deposited 100, she got 95; 5 was taken in fees. 
        
        console.log("vault total tokens (transferred in by Alice):", usualToken.balanceOf(address(usualX)) / 1 ether); 
        // vault has 100 tokens. The ones transferred by Alice. 
        
        uint256 maxWith = usualX.maxWithdraw(address(alice)); 
        console.log("alice max withdrawable tokens:", maxWith / 1 ether, "with 5 charged as fees");
        // alice's max withdraw is 95 as expected. 

        uint256 initialTotalAssets = usualX.totalAssets();
        // alice has no usualToken after she deposited everything

        maxWith = usualX.maxWithdraw(address(alice)); 
        usualX.withdraw(maxWith, alice, alice); 
        vm.stopPrank();
        console.log("alice withdraws all 95 tokens"); 
        
        maxWith = usualX.maxWithdraw(address(alice)); 
        console.log("alice maxWithdraw after withdrawal", maxWith);
        // alice's max withdrawl amount decreases to 0 ether as expected
        
        console.log("tokens in alice's wallet after withdrawal", usualToken.balanceOf(alice) / 1 ether); 
        // alice got 95 tokens transferred after withdrawl as expected. 

        console.log("Fees calculated by the withdraw function:", _calculateFee(withdrawAmount), "(4.75) instead of 5"); 

        // console.log("decrease in assets of vault:", initialTotalAssets - usualX.totalAssets(), "(99.75)."); 
        console.log("remaining assets in vault", usualX.totalAssets(), "(0.25) should be 0. This should have been added to the fees, but is not accounted for anywhere."); 
```

Use the following command to run this test: 

`forge test --mt test_fees_for_withdraw -vv`

You will get the following logs: 

  vault total tokens (transferred in by Alice): 100
  alice max withdrawable tokens: 95 with 5 charged as fees
  alice withdraws all 95 tokens
  alice maxWithdraw after withdrawal 0
  tokens in alice's wallet after withdrawal 95
  Fees calculated by the withdraw function: 4750000000000000000 (4.75) instead of 5
  remaining assets in vault 250000000000000000 (0.25) should be 0. This should have been 
  added to the fees, but is not accounted for anywhere.



### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, consider doing the following: 
1. Use the `UsualX::balanceOf()` function to get the total amount deposited by the user. 
2. Then calculate the `fee` from the total amount. 
3. Then use the ratio of `amount_to_withdraw : amount_deposited` to calculate the relative `fee` to be subtracted from the total fee.
