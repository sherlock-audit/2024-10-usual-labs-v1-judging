# Redeem Function Fails Due to Incorrect Sequence of Fee Minting in daoCollateral

### Summary

The redeem function in daoCollateral fails due to an incorrect sequence of operations, where fees are minted before burning the user's usd0 tokens and transferring the equivalent RWA (Real-World Asset) tokens. This leads to an unintended increase in the usd0 total supply, causing the transaction to revert. Specifically, attempting to mint fees first results in a supply imbalance, as the usd0 minted fee amount increases the supply before the user’s tokens are reduced, causing a failure.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the redeem function's sequence:

Step 1 (Fee Minting): The function mints the fee amount of usd0 tokens to the treasury.
Step 2 (Token Burn): The function then burns the user's usd0 tokens.
Step 3 (RWA Transfer): Finally, the function transfers the RWA tokens (minus the fee) to the user.
In this sequence, minting the fee amount to the treasury at the start temporarily inflates the usd0 total supply, leading to an imbalance that causes the minting step to revert due to lack of corresponding RWA backing in the treasury.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Supply-Backing Consistency: usd0 total supply must always have equivalent RWA backing in the treasury.

2. Fee must be set
3. Minting Permission: Any usd0 minted must have corresponding assets or fees already in the treasury to avoid reverting.

### External pre-conditions

1. User’s usd0 Balance: The user calling redeem must have sufficient usd0 tokens in their balance.
3. Fee Settings: The redeem function requires a redeem fee to be set by an authorized account.

### Attack Path

1. Denial of Service (DoS): This flaw effectively blocks all users from redeeming usd0 under certain conditions, as any attempt to mint the fee before adjusting the balance can lead to a consistent failure, thus preventing legitimate redemption.

### Impact

1. Transaction Failure: The redeem function reverts due to an increase in the total supply of usd0 without corresponding RWA assets.
2. Blocked Redemption: Users are unable to redeem usd0 for RWA tokens as expected.

```solidity
function test_Redeemerror() public {
        uint256 amount = 100 ether;
        (RwaMock token, Usd0 stbc) = testRWASwapcybrid(amount);
        uint256 fee = 1000; // 10%
        vm.prank(admin);
        daoCollateral.setRedeemFee(fee);


        vm.startPrank(alice);
        uint256 usd0Amount = stbc.balanceOf(alice);
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(AmountExceedBacking.selector));
        daoCollateral.redeem(address(token), usd0Amount, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }


    function testRWASwapcybrid(uint256 amount) public returns (RwaMock, Usd0) {
        amount = bound(amount, 1e6, type(uint128).max - 1);
        (RwaMock token, Usd0 stbc) = setupCreationRwaCybrid_withMint(6, amount);

        uint256 amountInUsd = amount * 1e12;
        vm.prank(alice);
        daoCollateral.swap(address(token), amount, amountInUsd);
        // it is the same as price is 1e18 except for the imprecision

        assertEq(stbc.balanceOf(alice), amountInUsd);
        return (token, stbc);
    }

     function setupCreationRwaCybrid_withMint(uint8 decimals, uint256 amount)
        public
        returns (RwaMock, Usd0)
    {
        (RwaMock token, Usd0 stbc) = setupCreationRwa1(decimals);
        // deal(address(token), treasury, amount);
        token.mint(alice, amount);
        vm.prank(alice);
        token.approve(address(daoCollateral), amount);
        return (token, stbc);
    }
```

### Mitigation

1. Reorder Operations in redeem:

  Step 1: Burn the usd0 tokens from the user first.
  Step 2: Transfer the equivalent RWA tokens, minus the fee, to the user.
  Step 3: Mint the fee amount of usd0 directly to the treasury at the end.

2. Prefunding of the treasury with some RWA token after deploy
