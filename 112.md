# Tax-paid users can claim airdrop with higher rewards than expected

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

Users can `claim()` their 100% airdrop amount by paying a small tax to the [collector](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.sol#L241) contract. This way they don't have to wait each month to pass, to claim a percentage of their airdrop amount. Although, even user had paid tax, they are still required to pay penalties, which is applied for past, ongoing and the next month(according to contract [readme here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/tree/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop#functionality-breakdown)). For ex., if exactly one month has passed since the airdrop distribution began, the `_computePenalty()` function below will penalize the claimant for two months (the past month and the next month) by adding 1 to `monthsPassed` value, 

```solidity
    function _available(
        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $,
        address account,
        uint256 totalAmount,
        bool isTop80
    ) internal returns (uint256, uint256) {
        ...snip..
        uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();

        if (isTop80) {
            penaltyAmount = _computePenalty(
                $, totalAmount, account, hasPaidTax ? monthsPassed + 1 : monthsPassed
            );
        }
        ...snip...
    }
```
However, no penalties will be imposed on the users for the next month if they wait longer than `n` month(and < `n +1` month). Take similar example, if 1 month + 15 days have passed, penalties are currently imposed only for the past month and the current month, with no penalties for the next month—this outcome is not anticipated by the protocol.

### Impact

Airdrop claimants receive less penalties to their total reward amount, end up claiming more than they should

### PoC

Under **test/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.t.sol**, run `forge test --mt testSkippingNextMonthPenality`
```solidity
    function testSkippingNextMonthPenality() external {
        uint256 amount = 1 ether;
        deal(address(usd0PP), address(alice), amount);
        vm.startPrank(airdropOperator);
        address[] memory addressesToAllocateTo = new address[](1);
        addressesToAllocateTo[0] = alice;
        uint256[] memory prelaunchBalances = new uint256[](1);
        prelaunchBalances[0] = amount;
        airdropTaxCollector.setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances(addressesToAllocateTo, prelaunchBalances);
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 penalty = 5000; // 50%
        uint256[] memory penalties = new uint256[](1);
        penalties[0] = penalty;
        address[] memory accounts = new address[](1);
        accounts[0] = alice;

        vm.startPrank(airdropPenaltyOperator);
        airdropDistribution.setPenaltyPercentages(penalties, accounts, 1);
        airdropDistribution.setPenaltyPercentages(penalties, accounts, 2);
        airdropDistribution.setPenaltyPercentages(penalties, accounts, 3);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // change timestamp to 45th day
        vm.warp(FIRST_AIRDROP_VESTING_CLAIMING_DATE + 15 days);

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        uint256 taxToPay = airdropTaxCollector.calculateClaimTaxAmount(alice);
        usd0PP.approve(address(airdropTaxCollector), taxToPay);
        airdropTaxCollector.payTaxAmount();

        airdropDistribution.claim(alice, true, aliceAmount, _aliceProof());

        uint256 oneSixthAlice = aliceAmount / 6;

        // Penalties supposed to be charge for 3 months(last month, current ongoing month and the next month), however, its failed to penalize for next month
        assertNotEq(
            usualToken.balanceOf(alice),
            aliceAmount - oneSixthAlice.mulDiv(penalty, BASIS_POINT_BASE) * 3
        );
    }
```

### Mitigation

Similar to the current month, apply penalties for the next month as well, or update the linked README above accordingly
