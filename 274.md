# Front-running Airdrop penalties mechanism allow actors to gain MEV

### Summary

"Top80" eligible users for the airdrop can front-run the protocol penalties, particularly during the last month of the vesting period, to maximize their claimable amount while avoiding penalties if there are any applied due to not proper vesting behaviour of the user. 

### Root Cause

The [AirdropDistribution#setPenaltyPercentages()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L363) function allows penalties to be applied retroactively within the vesting period. However, since users can claim their tokens before penalties for the final month are set, they can avoid paying penalties entirely by front-running the penalty application during the `1 <= N <= 6` month if there aren't any penalties being applied to them for the given month.

Unbehaved vestors can claim their full entitled airdrop before penalties are applied for the final month, circumventing the intended penalty application.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Any penalty for the current month are not applied to the user.

### External pre-conditions

1. Users must monitor the contract for penalty application updates.
1. Penalties must not have been applied for the `N` month before the claim.

### Attack Path

1. Monitor Pending Penalty Application:
> Malicious users observe penalty-setting transactions for the 6th month.

2.Claim Before Penalties Are Applied:
> Submit a claim transaction immediately before penalties for the final month are applied.
> By doing so, users avoid the penalty for the highest claimable period, maximizing their reward.

### Impact

Front-running the penalties applied due to bad vesting behaviour allows the malicious actors to gain more tokens than intended, harming fair distribution among participants.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce that all penalties for prior months must be applied before allowing claims for the given month.
