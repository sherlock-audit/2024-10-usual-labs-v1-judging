# Missing Challenge Status Implementation and Verification in Off-Chain Distribution

### Summary

The `DistributionModule.sol` contract’s current implementation of off-chain distribution management diverges from the expected functionality as described in the README (`https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/README.md?plain=1#L39`) documentation. The README specifies that each queued off-chain distribution should track an `isChallenged` status to identify whether it has been challenged, which is intended to prevent challenged distributions from being approved or claimed. However, this functionality has not been implemented, creating inconsistencies between the documentation and the code, and resulting in a security gap.

In the existing code:

	1.	QueuedOffChainDistribution [Struct](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/interfaces/distribution/IDistributionModule.sol#L6) : This struct, designed to hold off-chain distributions, includes timestamp and merkleRoot fields but lacks an isChallenged field. This absence prevents the system from formally marking distributions as challenged.
	2.	challengeOffChainDistribution(uint256 _timestamp) ([link to the code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L703)): According to the README, this function should challenge distributions in the queue that are older than a given _timestamp, setting their isChallenged flag to true. However, the function currently only removes distributions that are outdated based on _timestamp, without marking them as challenged, which deviates from the documented behavior.
	3.	approveUnchallengedOffChainDistribution() ([link to the code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L427)) : This function is designed to approve only unchallenged distributions. Since there is no isChallenged status implemented, the function cannot differentiate between challenged and unchallenged entries, and it may inadvertently approve challenged distributions. This contradicts the README’s intent, where the function should ensure only unchallenged distributions are approved.
	4.	claimOffChainDistribution(address account, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof) ([link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L386)) : Per the README, this function should prevent claims against challenged distributions. However, there is no check to verify whether a distribution has been challenged, allowing users to claim tokens from disputed distributions and bypassing the intended challenge protections.

The lack of an isChallenged field and verification checks in these functions results in a design inconsistency that undermines the security of the distribution system, making it possible for challenged distributions to be claimed and approved. This discrepancy between the README’s specified behavior and the actual code implementation exposes the contract to potential misuse and calls for an immediate update to align functionality with the documentation.

### Root Cause

In DistributionModule.sol::386 the choice to omit an isChallenged status check in the claimOffChainDistribution function is a mistake, as it allows claiming distributions even if they have been challenged according to the intended design.

### Internal pre-conditions

	1.	Distribution Operator Role needs to call queueOffChainUsualDistribution to add a new off-chain distribution to the queue, setting {variable} to include the distribution’s timestamp and merkleRoot.
	2.	DISTRIBUTION_OPERATOR_ROLE must wait for USUAL_DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGE_PERIOD to pass before calling approveUnchallengedOffChainDistribution, allowing distributions to become eligible for approval.
	3.	DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGER_ROLE does not challenge the queued distribution(s) within USUAL_DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGE_PERIOD, leaving it unchallenged and unmarked.
	4.	The claimant does not verify any isChallenged status check in the claimOffChainDistribution function before attempting to claim, as isChallenged status is not implemented.
	5.	No record or marking of isChallenged in QueuedOffChainDistribution struct or storage, leaving all queued distributions claimable by default without additional checks.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

	1.	Distribution Operator Role calls queueOffChainUsualDistribution to add a new off-chain distribution with a timestamp and merkleRoot to the queue.
	2.	Time passes, allowing the USUAL_DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGE_PERIOD to elapse, during which no DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGER_ROLE challenges the distribution, as it remains unmarked for any isChallenged status.
	3.	Any User calls approveUnchallengedOffChainDistribution, which approves all eligible (unchallenged) distributions in the queue that have passed the USUAL_DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGE_PERIOD. Because no isChallenged field exists in the queue entries, this function unintentionally approves all queued entries without any verification of challenges.
	4.	Claimant calls claimOffChainDistribution with an address and proof, bypassing any challenge check, as isChallenged status is not implemented in the struct or validated in the function.
	5.	Claimant successfully receives tokens minted based on the unchallenged (yet potentially invalid) distribution, exploiting the absence of challenge verification.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a critical loss of control over token distribution integrity, enabling unverified and potentially fraudulent claims. This flaw allows attackers to exploit unchallenged distributions, leading to unauthorized token issuance, significant asset misallocation, and a breach of distribution trust. The attacker seizes unearned tokens, jeopardizing protocol credibility and exposing the system to substantial financial and reputational damage.
