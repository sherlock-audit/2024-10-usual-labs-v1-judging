as can be seen above the fee calculation used to calculate the fee in previewWithdraw is not the same used to calculate the removed fee in withdraw 
this would mean that less fee us removed from the totalAssets than is paid by the withdrawer 


however in the withdraw itself 

here fee would be calculated to be only 250 asset equivalent to 250 shares while the total shares paid in fees is 331 only 250 would be burned

### Root Cause

wrong fee calculation 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

loss in fees 

### PoC

for example if assuming a 1:1 ratio and a 25% fee 
if 1000 assets is specified to be removed then the fee would be calculated as 1000 * 25 / (100 - 25) = 331(ceiled)
meaning the total fees shares would be 331 

however in the withdraw function 
the calculated fee is 1000 * 25 / 75 = 250 
hence 331 shares is burned for fees but only 250 is removed 

### Mitigation

the fee calculation in withdraw should be same as that in previewWithdtraw
