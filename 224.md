# No slippage check in the `DaoCollateral._swapRWAtoStbc()` function

### Summary

There is no slippage check for the received USDC amount in the `_swapRWAtoStbc()` function.

### Root Cause

In the [_swapRWAtoStbc()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/tree/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L612) function, there is no slippage check for the USDC amount that the user receives.

This function facilitates the swap from `RWA` to `USD0` to `USDC`.

The absence of a slippage check may result in the user receiving less USDC than expected, particularly when the price of RWAs declines.

In contrast, the [swap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/tree/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L693) and [redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/tree/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L726) functions implement a minimum receive amount check.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Users may receive significantly less USDC than expected.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Implement a minimum amount check for the USDC received.

This may be a bit difficult for the `swapRWAtoStbcIntent()` function, as the swap is divided into several transactions in this case. In this situation, you can perform a minimum price check for the RWA.
