# The penalty is not applied to Users  for  group Top20 even if they misbehave its only applied to Users in group Top80.

### Summary

In `AirdropDistribution`, the airdrop are based on the holdings of pills and user are divided in two groups : top80 and top20. So ,`` If the user misbehaves a penalty will be deducted from their rewards which should be the case for users in groups Top 80 and Top 20 but its only applied for user in groups in top80.``
 .
### Root Cause

In ``AirdropDistribution``, penalty is not applied for users in groups Top 20 even if they misbehave .Only applied for Top80 .
```solidity
@> if (isTop80) {   
      penaltyAmount = _computePenalty(
        $,
        totalAmount,
        account,
        hasPaidTax ? monthsPassed + 1 : monthsPassed
      );
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. User should be in Top 20.

### Attack Path

1. Assume user misbehaves and
2. User calls claim ``AirdropDistrbution:claim``.
3. User should be penaltied but User receive rewards without penalty.

### Impact

users in group top20 is not penaltied even if they misbehave.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
remove if statement to apply penalty for user from both groups.
```diff
if (isTop80 && !hasPaidTax) {
      
      if (monthsPassed == 0) {
        revert NotClaimableYet();
      }
      claimableAmount = totalAmount.mulDiv(
        monthsPassed,
        AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS // 6 value
      );
    }

--    if (isTop80) {
      penaltyAmount = _computePenalty(
        $,
        totalAmount,
        account,
        hasPaidTax ? monthsPassed + 1 : monthsPassed
      );
-- }
