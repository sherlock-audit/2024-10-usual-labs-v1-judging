# Malicious airdrop users will be able to avoid penalties applied to the last passed month

### Summary

The protocol allows penalties to be set for the most recent passed month in the vesting period. However, malicious user can avoid such penalties by frontrunning the penalty-setting transactions, allowing them to claim more tokens than intended.

### Root Cause

The protocol allows penalty adjustments to be set retroactively but only for the last passed month:

If an airdrop penalty operator sets a penalty for an account for the last vesting month, a malicious user can frontrun the transaction and claim their tokens before the penalty is applied. This is possible because there is no cooldown period and users can immediately claim all claimable tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Airdrop penalty operator sets a penalty for an account for the last vesting month.
2. The account has not yet claimed the tokens vested for the last month.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice has a total vesting of 6,000 USUAL tokens.
2. After 5 months, she can claim 5,000 USUAL tokens.
3. The penalty operator sets a 100% penalty for months 5 and 6, meaning Aliceâ€™s claimable amount should reduce by 2,000 tokens, allowing her to claim only 4,000 tokens.
4. Alice frontruns this penalty-setting transaction and claims her full 5,000 tokens before the penalty applies.
5. This circumvents the intended penalty reduction, allowing her to avoid the intended 2,000-token penalty.

### Impact

Malicious users can avoid penalties applied to the last vesting month tokens, enabling them to claim more tokens than intended and thus creating an unfair distribution and diluting value for compliant participants.

### Mitigation

Introduce a claim queue with a cooldown period of at least 1 block to ensure penalty-setting transactions cannot be frontrun.
