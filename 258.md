# Storage collision risk in upgradeable contracts

## Summary
The use of hardcoded storage slots in token contracts will cause storage collisions in upgradeable contracts as an overlapping slot can corrupt contract state

## Root Cause
```javascript
  bytes32 public constant Usd0PPStorageV0Location =
        0x1519c21cc5b6e62f5c0018a7d32a0d00805e5b91f6eaa9f7bc303641242e3000;
```
```javascript
function _usd0ppStorageV0() internal pure returns (Usd0PPStorageV0 storage $) {
        bytes32 position = Usd0PPStorageV0Location;
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
        assembly {
            $.slot := position
        }
    }
```

using a fixed storage slot without ensuring uniqueness can lead to collisions when multiple contracts or inherited contracts use the same slot.

## Internal Pre-conditions
- Multiple upgradeable contracts with inheritance as the project inherits from common base contracts.
- Hardcoded storage slots are used without a collision prevention mechanism.

## Impact
Corruption of contract state leading to unexpected behaviors. 
Could lead to loss of funds or unauthorized access.
## Mitigation
Use unique and deterministic storage slots to prevent collisions.
Instead of hardcoding the storage slot, derive it using a unique identifier.
Openzeppellin's ``StorageSlotUpgradeables`` utility or similar patterns to safely manage storage slots.
