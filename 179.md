# OffChainDistributionQueue Can be DoSed Because of Costly resetOffChainDistributionQueue

### Summary

Despite efforts to make sure it can't be done, OffChainDistributionQueue can still be DoSed. The `resetOffChainDistributionQueue` function was added to ensure any case where the queue has too many values can be fixed by resetting the queue. Since the delete used requires gas spent with every value deleted, the queue can still be DoSed with reset not being an option if there are enough values in it.

### Root Cause

The root of the issue is the plain delete here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L698

This delete needs to go through the entire array and delete every element individually, rather than something like a mapping where the pointer to the elements would be deleted.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Admin adds enough values to offChainDistributionQueue such that a delete of every value would overflow the gas allowed on a block.
2. Contract is now bricked.

### Impact

It would completely brick all distribution.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow reset to delete certain numbers of elements at a time, or attempt to delete them all until a certain amount of gas is used then it can be called again.
