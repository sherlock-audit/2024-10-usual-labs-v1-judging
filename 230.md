# DaoCollateral::swapWithPermit Restricts Usage to only the owner of the signature

### Summary

The swapWithPermit function in DaoCollateral is designed to allow signature-based authorization to perform token swaps without requiring prior approval. However, the implementation currently limits the function to be used exclusively by the signature owner, this is as a result of the default `msg.sender` which will only be correct when it is called by the signature owner, which restricts the functionality and usability intended by the permit design.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L710

The msg.sender is hardcode in the swapWithPermit function, the first parameter of the IERC20Permit(rwaToken).permit should be the owner of the signature, but because the msg.sender was hardcoded, it will be the address of anyone that call the swapWithPermit and we only be valid when it is called by the owner of the signature.

```solidity
 function swapWithPermit(
        address rwaToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external {
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
 @>       try IERC20Permit(rwaToken).permit(msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s) {}
            catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
        swap(rwaToken, amount, minAmountOut);
    }
```

 This contradicts the intended use of permits, which are designed to allow any authorized party with a valid signature to execute the permitted action.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Authorized users cannot utilize the signature for the swap, forcing only the original owner to perform actions, which could limit the flexibility of multi-user workflows.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the function to accept an address user parameter, enabling any authorized user with the correct signature to perform the swap on behalf of the owner.
