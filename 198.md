# Potential Front-Running Vulnerability in removeOriginalAllocation Function

### Summary

The [removeOriginalAllocation function ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L367)in UsualSP.sol is vulnerable to front-running, which could allow users to claim their original allocation before it is reset. This function is used to set both originalAllocation and originalClaimed values to zero for each recipient provided in the recipients array. While it’s intended to be used by authorized operators (as enforced by onlyMatchingRole(USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE)), this role-based control does not prevent potential front-running by users who may still have access to their allocated funds.

Since the function does not pause claims or directly manage user access to funds, a malicious user could see an impending reset call and quickly claim their allocation before it is set to zero. This front-running scenario would allow the attacker to exploit a timing gap, effectively bypassing the reset and extracting funds that should have been invalidated. This vulnerability is particularly concerning if removeOriginalAllocation is executed with the assumption that recipients have not claimed their full allocation.

In a high-stakes scenario, if an attacker claims the maximum allocation amount just before the reset transaction is confirmed, the protocol suffers from unanticipated fund losses, as it cannot reverse claimed tokens. Addressing this vulnerability is crucial to ensuring that intended resets do not get undermined by quick actions on the part of recipients.

### Root Cause

In UsualSP.sol: removeOriginalAllocation:line 367 the lack of a mechanism to temporarily disable claims during allocation resets allows recipients to front-run the function and claim their allocation before it is set to zero.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` calls `removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients)` on `UsualSP.sol` contract with one of the recipients being the attacker address.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

	1.	Attacker is aware that an admin is about to call removeOriginalAllocation to reset their allocation.
	2.	Attacker front-runs the transaction by calling the claim function to withdraw the maximum amount available in originalAllocation.

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of the entire original allocation amount that was intended to be reset. [The attacker gains the full allocation, circumventing the protocol’s security controls and depleting funds that should have been safeguarded by the removal action.]

This vulnerability creates a serious loophole where unauthorized recipients can drain substantial funds by exploiting the lack of front-run protection. As a result, the protocol risks hemorrhaging critical assets with each attempt to remove allocations, undermining the intended governance controls and creating potential for severe financial abuse.
