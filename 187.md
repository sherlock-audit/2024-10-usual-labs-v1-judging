# Early Airdrop Unlocking Through Zero Tax Window

### Summary

Integer rounding in tax calculation logic will cause an advantageous early claiming opportunity for airdrop recipients as users can unlock tokens ~26 minutes before the official vesting end through zero-tax transactions, potentially benefiting from restricted supply before wider vesting unlock.


### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.sol#L232, the tax calculation uses integer division that causes rounding to zero in two scenarios:

1. Time-based rounding:

```solidity
uint256 taxFee = $.maxChargeableTax.mulDiv(claimingTimeLeft, AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH);
```
With AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH = 15,724,800 seconds (182 days):
Rounds to zero when claimingTimeLeft < 15,724,800/10000 = 1,572.48 seconds (â‰ˆ26.2 minutes)


2. Balance-based rounding:

```solidity
claimTaxAmount = claimerUsd0PPBalance.mulDiv(taxFee, BASIS_POINT_BASE);
```

Can round to zero for very small USD0PP balances relative to the current taxFee

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User waits until ~26 minutes before the official end of the claiming period
2. User calls payTaxAmount()
3. Due to integer rounding, tax calculates to zero
4. Transaction succeeds, marking user as having paid tax with zero payment
5. User can now claim their airdrop tokens without vesting restrictions

### Impact

This creates a opportunity where savvy users can:

- Unlock their airdrop tokens ~26 minutes before the intended vesting end
- Potentially benefit from better market prices due to:
  - Most users waiting for the complete vesting period
  - Limited token supply in circulation during this window

### Mitigation

Consider adding a minimum tax amount check or adjusting the calculation to prevent rounding to zero
