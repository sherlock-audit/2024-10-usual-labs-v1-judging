# Redemption Will Always Revert When USDO Supply Nears RWA Backing Limit or equal to RWA backing `USDO

### Summary

The `DaoCollateral` contract contains a critical flaw in its redemption logic. During the redemption process, the contract mints a stable fee to the treasury before burning the user's USDO tokens. If the USDO supply is near or has already reached the RWA backing limit, this additional minting causes the total supply of USDO to exceed the collateral-backed limit. Consequently, the transaction reverts with an AmountExceedBacking error.

This flaw results in a Denial of Service (DoS) for all users attempting to redeem USDO, effectively trapping their funds. Once the USDO supply reaches the RWA backing cap, no user can redeem their tokens, rendering the core functionality of the system ioperable.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L567

The system mints a stable fee to the treasury before burning the user’s USDO tokens during redemption. If the USDO supply is already close to the RWA backing limit, this minting operation can cause the total supply to temporarily exceed the backing, triggering a revert (AmountExceedBacking).

### Internal pre-conditions

The pre-condition for this to occur doesn't require many things to be in parallel, it just require this 2 conditions to meet which makes likelihood very high.

1.The total supply of USDO (totalSupply()) is close to or has already reached the maximum collateral-backed supply (wadRwaBackingInUSD).
2.The fee for the redemption operation is greater than zero.

### External pre-conditions

Nothing

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

DOS or user will never be able to redemptions, 
The issue persists until the backing ratio changes, making the system highly fragile and prone to permanent reverts under normal operational scenarios.

### PoC

Lets Explain the whole scenario by describing How USDO minting first and how redeem lead to DOS.
first lets take a look `USDO:mint()` function - 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L468
so lets start From minting the USDO, if we see the `_transferRWATokenAndMintStable` carefully it require the msg.sender to send Transfer the tokens prior to mint USDO, 
Means first collateral is transferred to treasury and then in USDO mint function, it mints by checking total supply + amount shodule be equal to less then RWA assets backing USDO.
means `RWA backing == totalSupply:USDO`

redeem function:
Assume USDO supply = 1_000_000 USDO and sum of RWA = 1_000_000 RWA for simplicity 
lets take redeem Fee = MAX_REDEEM_FEE = 2500 BASIS_POINTS,
lets calculate redeem Fee and Flow of Assets
1. USER redeem tokens = 10,000 
2. Redeem fee = (10_000 * 2500) / 10_000 = 2500 Fee (will be deducted from the USER)
3. while minting treasury 2500 tokens,  
 1_000_000 + 2500 > 1_000_000 -> revert 
result => it will revert because minting supply exceeds the RWA backing it

Reason -> as the no new RWA tokens was transferred to treasury (which is done in usual minting process which back the new mints), so the calculated Fee which will be minted to treasury, it will revert. as the tokens exceeds the RWA supply

burn the user USDO shares prior to minting the new USDO Fee to treasury contract. which will solve this issue as totalsupply of USDO will be decreased compare to RWA backing it.
 redeem -> calculate Fee -> burn USER USDO -> mint Treasury Fee -> transfer asset to USER.



### Mitigation

Burn Before Minting: Reverse the order of operations to burn the user’s USDO before minting the stable fee
