# Inadequate Manipulation Protection in USYC Oracle

### Summary

The oracle for USYC does not have adequate protection against its manipulation. It has normal oracle protections, but should include a function similar to checking depeg for stablecoins.

Since USYC is a generally stable asset with fairly predictable price increases, a limiter similar to this https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-correlated-asset-price-oracle/16133 should be used to protect against manipulation. It would allow for price increases or decreases from day-to-day, but a major price change would be blocked from updating. 

This is especially important because I believe the USYC oracle is only a single source of truth so manipulation is much more likely than other assets.

### Root Cause

I believe https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L82 is what's used for USYC, and lack of the check there is the problem.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

This becoming a problem relies on something happening, whether malicious or accidental, to the USYC price submitter.

### Attack Path

1. Malicious or accidental oracle submission changes price drastically.
2. Oracle accepts the price without question and causes major damage on the protocol.

### Impact

Although unlikely because it relies on the oracle submitter, the protocol could suffer complete losses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a growing depeg threshold for USYC just like there is for stablecoins.
