# tax paying user can avoid paying penalty amount

### Summary

For Top 80% users who have opted to pay a tax, they are granted the ability to skip the vesting schedule and claim the full airdrop amount immediately these users will also have to pay a penalty amount however a vulnerability allows them to avoid paying penalty

when users call calim in aidropdistribution.sol it calls available to calculate how much the user can claim

for users who paid tax the function calls compute penalty

the penalty is calculated as

The function iterates over each month that has passed, from 1 to monthsPassed.

For each month, it checks the penalty percentage for the user in that month ($.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i]).

If the penalty is 0, it means there is no penalty for that month, so the loop continues to the next month.
If the penalty is BASIS_POINT_BASE (i.e., 100%), the user has a full penalty for that month, so the full one-sixth of the total airdrop is added to the penalty.
If the penalty is not 0 or 100%, a partial penalty is calculated based on the specific percentage for that month, using the formula

however theres a very high chance that the penalty can be 0 by executing the claim before the penalty operator can set the penalty amount for the claimer and

if the user has no penalties for any of the months (i.e., all penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i] values are 0 for all months), the loop will simply iterate over all the months without adding any penalties, and the function will return

### Impact

loss of funds for protocol user avoids paying penalty amount

### PoC

consider a scenario 
bob who is top 80% wants to avoid vesting so he pays tax and decides to claim the whole amount 

-bob pays the tax 
-bob immediately calls the claim to claim his full amount before the penalty operator can set the penalty amount for bob
-bob avoids paying any penalty

this is very much possible because the operator will only set the penalty for users who paid tax if bob executes his transaction quick enough he can easily avoid paying any penalty

### Mitigation

implement checks to ensure that the user cant claim before the penalty operator sets the penalty amount
or maybe calculate the penalty amount while collecting tax
