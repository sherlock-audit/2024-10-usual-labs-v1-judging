# The function removeOriginalAllocation may cause inconsistency issues and affect reward distribution.

### Summary

There are two problems with the current function removeOriginalAllocation. First, it does not check whether the reward recipient has received all the rewards. Second, when the reward recipient has not received all the rewards, totalStaked will be greater than the sum of the balances of all accounts, thus reducing the rewards for all users.

For example, when the user still has part of the reward (100e18) left to claim, function removeOriginalAllocation will directly clear its originalAllocation and originalClaimed. Since the reward is still in the contract, part of the balance in totalStaked will include the rewards, making totalStaked greater than the sum of the balances of all accounts(100e18). This is because the user's balance is calculated like this:

```solidity
    function balanceOf(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        return
            $.liquidAllocation[account] + $.originalAllocation[account] - $.originalClaimed[account];
    }
```
Finally, all users will receive less rewards.

### Root Cause

Function removeOriginalAllocation does not check whether the reward recipient has received all the rewards. When reward is not claimed totally, it should transfer to someone(uesr or platform).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There are some rewards not claimed when calling the removeOriginalAllocation.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

All users will receive less rewards because totalStaked is greater than the sum of the balances of all accounts.

### PoC

### Mitigation
