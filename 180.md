# Penalty Change Can be Frontrun with Claim

### Summary

Because anyone can claim for any user and because setPenaltyPercentages can be used on the most recent month rather than only upcoming ones, `claim` can be called when penalty percentages are being adjusted for the most recent month to either avoid a higher percentage or maliciously inflict a higher percentage.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L371 setPenaltyPercentage here can be enacted on an already passed month (which may be a bug itself but I'm not sure if that's intended).

And https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L314C5-L314C13 claim here can be called for anyone.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Watch for penalty percentage changes on the most recent month
2. If a percentage is changing favorably, a malicious actor can call claim to make sure a victim gets a worse penalty
3. If a percentage is changing unfavorably, you can call your own claim to get the favorable price

### Impact

Makes it so penalty changes for the most recent month can be frontrun to give users better or worse pricing depending on the situation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't allow setting penalty percentage for the most recent month passed and/or make claim only able to be called for yourself.
