# If the users start depositing after the yield started their fund can get permanently unlocked

### Summary

The issue happens when the user starts depositing after the `yieldDistribution` has started for the vault `UsualX`.
Similar to donation attack , instead of an attacker , the `totalDeposit` accumulated as part of the usual yield process causes this issue of loss of funds for the users.[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L212)

1. Suppose, `usualDistribution` module call `startYieldDistribution()` with `yieldAmount` = `24e18` (1e18 Usual / hour).
2. After `3` hours, when the totalAssets reached `3e18` , `Alice` deposited `3e18` usual tokens.
3. The calculation for `Alices` shares is, 
    ```solidity
    assets.mulDiv(totalSupply() + 10 ** _decimalsOffset(), totalAssets() + 1, rounding)
    ```
    i.e.   (3e18 *(0 + 1e18) )/ 3e18 +1  => 0 .

4. Hence `0` shares are minted for `Alice`.
5. If she tries to withdraw her shares , it will revert with `ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw()` message.


Note that all the subsequent users will also get `0 shares` for their `assets` deposited, if their `assets` <= `totalDeposits`. 
And on each deposits , totalDeposits increases along with the yield , so as the time goes by the assets thats can be lost due to this issue also become larger.


### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is due to an incorrect calculation in the share allocation formula within the vault contract, which results in zero shares being minted for new depositors under certain conditions. This can lead to a critical vulnerability, where all future depositors receive zero shares, making their deposits effectively unrecoverable.

### Internal pre-conditions

User deposited after the Vault started yielding Usuals.
Deposit amount <= yieldrate * duration.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

mentioned in the summary

### Impact

The first user and the subsequent users who try to deposit assets into the vault after yield distribution has started will face loss of deposits, inability to withdraw, funds locked , can be exploited by an Attacker. d
