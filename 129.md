### Attack Path

Certain users are allocated early unlock amount, allowing them to early exit bonds during the temporary exit period.

For this group of users, they are allowed to execute the [`temporaryOneToOneExitUnwrap`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0PP.sol#L261) function to early exit bonds during the temporary exit period.

Assume that Bob's `bondEarlyUnlockAllowedAmount` is set to `1,000,000`, which allows them to exit up to 1,000,000 USD0PP bond early.

However, the right to exit early is not tied to the USD0PP bond owned by Bob. If he has an excess `bondEarlyUnlockAllowedAmount` allowance, he can help other users exit their bond early for free, in exchange for a small fee, or offer to unlock at a price slightly higher than the floor price benefiting from the spread.

```solidity
File: Usd0PP.sol
261:     function temporaryOneToOneExitUnwrap(uint256 amountToUnwrap)
..SNIP..
277:         if (amountToUnwrap > $.bondEarlyUnlockAllowedAmount[msg.sender]) {
278:             revert NotPermittedToEarlyUnlock();
279:         }
280: 
281:         if (balanceOf(msg.sender) < amountToUnwrap) {
282:             revert AmountTooBig();
283:         }
284: 
285:         // this is a one-time option. It consumes the entire balance, even if only used partially.
286:         $.bondEarlyUnlockAllowedAmount[msg.sender] = 0;
..SNIP..
293:         _burn(msg.sender, amountToUnwrap);
294: 
295:         $.usd0.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amountToUnwrap);
```
