# Incorrect withdrawal fee calculation in UsualX::withdraw function

### Summary

An incorrect formula for calculating the withdrawal fee in the `UsualX::withdraw` function leads to improper updates of the `YieldDataStorage.totalDeposits` state variable.

### Root Cause

The formula used to calculate the withdrawal fee in the `UsualX::withdraw` function is incorrect and inconsistent with the formula in the `UsualX::previewWithdraw` function. As a result, the fee calculated in `UsualX::withdraw` is lower than that calculated in `UsualX::previewWithdraw`.

```javascript
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
    public
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 shares)
{
    UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
    YieldDataStorage storage yieldStorage = _getYieldDataStorage();
    ...
    shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
=>  uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    ...
    yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
}
```
[UsualX::previewWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L396) function:
```javascript
function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares) {
    UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
=>  uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    ...
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- `UsualXStorageV0.withdrawFeeBps` must be greater than 0.

### External pre-conditions

- No external pre-conditions are required.

### Impact

The `YieldDataStorage.totalDeposits` state variable is updated incorrectly.

### Mitigation

Update the withdrawal fee calculation formula in the `UsualX::withdraw` function to ensure consistency and correctness.

```diff
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
    public
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 shares)
{
    ...
-   uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
+   uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    ...
}
