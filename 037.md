# In usualx vault deposit function directly deposit from ERC4626Upgradeable which bricks the vault.

### Summary

In this vault its intended to store totalDeposits in ``YieldBearingVault`` abstract contract but it rather calls ``ERC4626Upgradeable`` abstract contract  which doesnt store totalDeposits  which causes vault to brick core functions of vault due to underflow because the deposit function doesnt store  `` totalDeposits``.

```solidity
    /** @dev See {IERC4626-deposit}. */
    function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public virtual returns (uint256) {
        uint256 maxAssets = maxDeposit(receiver);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxDeposit(receiver, assets, maxAssets);
        }

        uint256 shares = previewDeposit(assets);
        _deposit(_msgSender(), receiver, assets, shares);

        return shares;
    } 
```

### Root Cause

In `UsualX:L308` , the deposit function doesnt call YieldBearingVault  deposit function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User deposit in the vault.
2. User wants to withdraw their deposit amount but it reverts due to underflow. 

### Impact

loss of funds for user : user who deposit in the vault can withdraw their deposit amount back .
brick of core function of vault . 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

call to YieldBearingVault deposit function to track totalDeposit.

```solidity 
    function depositWithPermit(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
        try IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), assets, deadline, v, r, s) {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
            catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks

++        return super._deposit(assets, receiver);
- -       return deposit(assets, receiver);

    }
