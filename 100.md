# Inconsistent withdrawal fee calculation between function withdraw and function redeem.

### Summary

in the withdraw function fee calculation is different and in the redeem function fee calculation is different, as a result in the withdraw function users have to pay more fee and in the redeem function users have to pay less fee.


### Root Cause

in the withdraw function fee calculation is different and in the redeem function fee calculation is different.

### Attack Path

1. Letâ€™s assume, Alice has deposited 200 amounts. withdrawFeeBps = 500(5%), BASIS_POINT_BASE = 10_000;
 
2. Alice calls the function withdraw with 100 amounts, see the function withdraw which calls the function previewWithdraw where fee = Math.mulDiv(
            assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil; i.e fee = 100e18*500/10000-500 = 100e18*500/9500 = 5.26e18 i.e 5.26, assetsWithFee = assets + fee = 100+5.26 = 105.26, so previewWithdraw function returns shares of 105.26 amounts.

3. Now see the function withdraw, here   shares = previewWithdraw(assets) = shares of 105.26 amounts, here fee is calculated differently i.e fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil) i.e  fee = 100e18*500/10000 = 5e18 = 5, so shares of 105.26 amounts are burned from alice and alice receives 100 amounts and 5 amounts of fee(not 5.26 amounts) is subtracted from totalDeposits i.e  yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
 
4. But in the function redeem, fee is taken less than the function withdraw because here fee calculation formula is only one i.e fee =
            Math.mulDiv(assetsWithoutFee, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil); so here for 100 amounts, fee will be only taken 5 and shares of  95 amounts will be burned.

5. So in the withdraw function users have to pay more fee and in the redeem function users have to pay less fee.

 function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares) {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        // Calculate the fee based on the equivalent assets of these shares
        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
            assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil
        );
        // Calculate total assets needed, including fee
        uint256 assetsWithFee = assets + fee;

        // Convert the total assets (including fee) to shares
        shares = _convertToShares(assetsWithFee, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    }

### Impact

 in the withdraw function users have to pay more fee and in the redeem function users have to pay less fee.


### PoC

### Mitigation

make the withdrawal fee calculation same for both the function withdraw and redeem.
