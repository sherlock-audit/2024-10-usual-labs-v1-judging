# User will pay more fees than they should when withdrawing in UsualX

### Summary

The fee calculation in `UsualX.previewWithdraw()` causes the user to pay more than they should.

### Root Cause

In [UsualX.sol:397](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L397) the fee is calculated as `amount * withdrawFeeBps / (BPS - withdrawFeeBps)`. Instead, it should be `amount * withdrawFeeBps / BPS`

Given that assets:shares is 1:1 and withdrawFeeBps = 500 (5%), I want to withdraw `1e18` assets:
`fee = 1e18 * 500 / 9500 = 5.2631579e+16`
`assetsWithFee = 1e18 + 5.26e16 = 1.0526e18`

So I pay slightly more than I should.

### Mitigation

```sol
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares) {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        // Calculate the fee based on the equivalent assets of these shares
        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
            assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil
        );
        // Calculate total assets needed, including fee
        uint256 assetsWithFee = assets + fee;

        // Convert the total assets (including fee) to shares
        shares = _convertToShares(assetsWithFee, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    }
```
