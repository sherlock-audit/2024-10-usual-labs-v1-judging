### Attack Path

Assuming that the duration of the vesting period is 48 months. Thus, during deployment, the `$.duration` will be set to 48 months when `UsualSP.initialize()` function below is executed. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L157

```solidity
File: UsualSP.sol
142:     function initialize(address _registryContract, uint256 _startDate, uint256 _duration)
..SNIP..
157:         $.duration = _duration;
158: 
159:         __RewardAccrualBase_init_unchained(address($.usual));
160:     }
```

However, within the `_released` function, the duration is hardcoded to 36 months (`NUMBER_OF_MONTHS_IN_THREE_YEARS`). Thus, the entire amount of the user's allocation will be vested completely earlier (3 years instead of 4 years)

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/constants.sol#L92

```solidity
File: constants.sol
92: uint256 constant NUMBER_OF_MONTHS_IN_THREE_YEARS = 36;
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L213

```solidity
File: UsualSP.sol
185:     /// @notice Check how much an insider can claim.
186:     /// @param $ The storage struct of the contract.
187:     /// @param insider The address of the insider.
188:     /// @return The total amount available to claim.
189:     function _released(UsualSPStorageV0 storage $, address insider)
..SNIP..
205:         } else {
206:             // Calculate the number of months passed since the cliff duration
207:             uint256 monthsPassed =
208:                 (block.timestamp - $.startDate - insiderCliffDuration) / ONE_MONTH;
209: 
210:             // Calculate the vested amount based on the number of months passed
211:             uint256 vestedAmount = totalAllocation.mulDiv(
212:                 totalMonthsInCliffDuration + monthsPassed,
213:                 NUMBER_OF_MONTHS_IN_THREE_YEARS, // @audit-info NUMBER_OF_MONTHS_IN_THREE_YEARS = 36
214:                 Math.Rounding.Floor
215:             );
216: 
217:             // Ensure we don't release more than the total allocation due to rounding
218:             return Math.min(vestedAmount, totalAllocation);
219:         }
220:     }
```

On the other hand, if the `$.duration` is set to 24 months, the vesting of USUAL tokens will be slower than expected.

### Impact

Severity: Medium. The USUAL tokens will be vested faster or slower than expected, breaking core contract functionality

### PoC

_No response_
