# Potential Front-Running Vulnerability in emergencyWithdraw Allowing Preemptive Unwrap Execution

### Summary

The `emergencyWithdraw(address safeAccount)` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0PP.sol#L400) in the Usd0PP contract can be front-run by malicious actors, allowing them to call the unwrap function before the emergencyWithdraw execution is completed. When emergencyWithdraw is executed, it transfers the entire USD0 balance from the contract to a designated safeAccount and then pauses the contract, preventing further operations.

However, because there’s no mechanism to prevent front-running, a malicious actor could potentially trigger an unwrap action, or similar claim, right before the emergencyWithdraw function is mined, thereby depleting part of the contract’s USD0 balance. This reduces the amount that emergencyWithdraw would transfer to the safeAccount, undermining the intended security and reserve allocation.

### Root Cause

In Usd0PP.sol: [400], there is no mechanism to prevent front-running on the emergencyWithdraw function. As a result, malicious actors can potentially execute the unwrap function just before emergencyWithdraw finalizes, reducing the contract’s USD0 balance and thus diminishing the funds transferred to the safeAccount.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` calls `emergencyWithdraw(address safeAccount)` on `Usd0PP` contract 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

	1.	Malicious User anticipates the admin’s emergency withdrawal action and front-runs the transaction by calling the unwrap function to remove a portion of the USD0 tokens.
	2.	Malicious User succeeds in reducing the USD0 balance held by the contract just before the emergencyWithdraw transaction executes.

### Impact

The protocol faces a severe risk of losing substantial USD0 token reserves intended for emergency protection. The attacker gains unauthorized access to critical USD0 assets by front-running the emergency withdrawal and quickly executing the unwrap function, draining funds that should be secured. This exploit exposes the protocol to potential catastrophic loss of funds, undermining the integrity of the emergency withdrawal mechanism and putting essential reserves at immediate risk.
