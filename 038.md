# User can't claim for another distribution even if its part of the distribution.

### Summary

In `DistributionModule.sol`, eligble user can claim rewards through `claimOffChainDistribution` function but claim is  limited to  one distribution due to mapping `claimedByOffChainClaimer`   because of this user cant claim for another distrbutioon even if the user is eligble. 
```solidity 
 mapping(address offChainClaimer => uint256 amount) claimedByOffChainClaimer;
```

> Sponser verified that claim can be made for each distrbution, given you are part of it.

### Root Cause

In `DistributionModule:L193` , the mapping ``claimedByOffChainClaimer`` only store for a single distrbution.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User claims tokens using ``claimOffChainDistribution``, assuming the total amount for user is 100 tokens in merkle tree.
2. User is eligble for claim for another distribution but cant claim if ``claimedByOffChainClaimer`` > total amount for user stored in merkle tree.

### Impact

loss of rewards for user.

### PoC


### Mitigation

in`` claimedByOffChainClaimer`` mapping store rewards claimed per distributions.
