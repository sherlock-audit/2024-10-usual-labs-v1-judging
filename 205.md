# Unallocated supply of UsualS steal rewards from users.

### Summary

The calculation of ```rewardPerTokenStored``` in the UsualSP contract depends on the ```totalStaked()``` function, which initially returns the total supply of the UsualS tokens that includes unallocated tokens rather than the actual staked amount. This results in ```rewardPerTokenStored``` being artificially low, effectively reducing rewards for users.

### Root Cause

After deploying the UsualSP contract, the stakeUsualS function is called, transferring the total supply of USUALS to UsualSP (confirmed by sponsor). Users then receive token allocations with a vesting schedule, allowing them to earn rewards based on this initial staked balance. However, the calculation of ```rewardPerTokenStored``` considers all circulating UsualS supply as “staked” from the beginning. 
Despite recent audit's fix to replace totalSupply() with totalStaked() in the rewardPerToken calculation, the issue persists, as totalStaked() still returns the total supply at the beginning and includes unallocated balance of the contract all the time.

### Internal pre-conditions

The allocated amount must remain lower than the total supply of UsualS.

### Impact

Users receive fewer rewards than they should and compete with unallocated supply of UsualS that is on the contract balance for rewards.
### PoC

To illustrate the effect, consider two scenarios for totalStaked():

When totalStaked() returns 360,000,000: rewardPerToken increases by 0.01 tokens per staked token.
When totalStaked() (real staked amount) returns 36,000,000 (10% of supply): rewardPerToken would increase by 0.1 tokens per staked token for the same period and balance.
In the first scenario, users receive 10 times fewer rewards per staked token compared to the second. 
### Mitigation

Introduce a variable that accounts for total staked and use that for calculation.
