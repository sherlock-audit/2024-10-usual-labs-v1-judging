# during a depeg a user can get more USD0PP and sell it for a higher price

### Summary

in the usdpp contract Users can stake USD0 to mint USD0++ at a 1:1 ratio .Users can later unwrap USD0++ after the bond period ends, receiving their original USD0 tokens back USD0++also  has a floor price that users can use to redeem USD0++ for USD0 at a minimum rate, ensuring liquidity even in times of high volatility The contract integrates a parity mechanism that helps stabilize the value of USD0++ and USD0 in periods of high volatility.
The system can interact with external liquidity pools (like Curve pool) to balance the USD0 and USD0++ pools by selling or buying tokens, ensuring the peg is maintained however a bug allows user to mint more tokens for less usd0 and receive a guaranteed profitable USD0++ when the USDP++ is depegged when the USD0++ (USD0PP) token is below peg, users will receive more USD0++ for less USD0 when they mint new USD0PP 

When the user calls the mint() function:
The contract accepts USD0 (collateral) from the user.
The contract then mints an equivalent amount of USD0++ to the user's address. If USD0++ is at the price of 0.8, and a user wants to mint 1 USD0PP, the contract will require only 0.8 USD0 to mint 1 USD0PP This means that more USD0PP is minted for the same amount of USD0, so users get more USD0PP for less USD0 this opens a window for a malicious user to make huge profit at the expense of the protocol as the user can instantly sell his usdp++ Since the user paid only 0.8 USD0 to mint each USD0++, and they can sell or unlock each USD0++ at the guranteed floor price of 1 USD0, they are effectively making a profit from the price discrepancy.

### Internal pre-conditions

token price depegs

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

loss of funds for protocol

### PoC

the USD0PP token price depegs 
and a parmechanism is triggered 
attacker sees this he mints usd0pp for less usd0 acquiring more tokens for less usd0
attacker calls the unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice 
the attacker makes profit at the expense of the protocol
additionally if the attacker decides he can also choose not to withdraw at floorprice and wait for the bond period to end or bond early unlock to start

### Mitigation

implement check to ensure that user dont mint more usd0pp for less usd0
