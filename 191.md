# Loss of Vesting Rewards Upon Allocation Removal

### Summary

Zeroing out of allocation records in removeOriginalAllocation() without updating user rewards causes loss of legitimately accrued rewards for vesting participants as the historical reward accrual state is not preserved, preventing users from claiming rewards earned during their vesting period.


### Root Cause

In UsualSP.sol at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L367 the removeOriginalAllocation() function improperly zeroes out both originalAllocation and originalClaimed state variables without preserving the user's accrued rewards state, making it impossible for users to claim rewards they earned during their legitimate vesting period.

```solidity
    function removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients) external {
        if (recipients.length == 0) {
            revert InvalidInputArraysLength();
        }


        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE);

       // No   _updateReward(recipients[i]) called for recipients
        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
            $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
            $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;


            emit RemovedOriginalAllocation(recipients[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

### Attack Path

- User has vesting allocation and accrues rewards based on (originalAllocation - originalClaimed)
- USUALSP_OPERATOR calls removeOriginalAllocation() for this user
- Function zeros out both originalAllocation and originalClaimed
- User's reward state is lost as their balance immediately becomes 0 but _updateReward is not called.
- User cannot claim legitimately earned rewards from their vesting period when they actually had allocation

### Impact

Vesting participants lose all accrued but unclaimed rewards that were earned during their legitimate vesting period
