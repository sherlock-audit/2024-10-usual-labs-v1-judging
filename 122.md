# Users can claim the whole airdrop amount ahead of schedule without paying any tax amount

### Summary

Due to precision loss, people will be able to claim their fully vested airdrop, from 4.5 hours up to 2 days + before it actually gets vested due to precision error.

To be more exact, the airdrop will be fully claimable 15,724 seconds before it actually is or up to 157,240 seconds, depending on what the tax % is 

Due to how the tax is calculated, this will result in in a tax of 0, which would allow users to “pay” 0 tax, and claim the airdrop prematurely without any value loss.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.sol#L232-L233

There are multiple options in to how the airdrop can actually be claimed, some of the options include: 

- The whole airdrop is claimable immediately for the bottom 20%;
- For the top 80% - paying a tax which would immediately unlock the full amount (in exchange for the fee/tax);
- Waiting for the vesting period to pass, and having a portion of the airdrop unlocked with each passing month.

Due to how the tax is calculated: 

```solidity
    function _calculateClaimTaxAmount(AirdropTaxCollectorStorage storage $, address account)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 claimTaxAmount) // 
    {
        uint256 claimerUsd0PPBalance = $.prelaunchUsd0ppBalance[account];

        uint256 claimingTimeLeft;
        if (block.timestamp > AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME + AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH) { 
            claimingTimeLeft = 0;
        } else {
            claimingTimeLeft =
                AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME + AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH - block.timestamp; 
        }
                            
        uint256 taxFee = $.maxChargeableTax.mulDiv(claimingTimeLeft, AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH); 
        claimTaxAmount = claimerUsd0PPBalance.mulDiv(taxFee, BASIS_POINT_BASE);
    }
```

The above formula is manipulable 4+ hours before the whole period unlocks due to precision loss, which would allow people to be counted as if they’ve paid the tax, while actually paying 0 tax. 

- `uint256 constant AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME = 1_734_004_800;`
- `uint256 constant AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH = 182 days;`
- 182 days = 15724800;

Whenever the `claimingTimeLeft` would be 15_724 or lower, the tax amount would result as 0 due to precision loss. 

For example: 

- `claimingTimeLeft = AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME + AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH - block.timestamp;`
- `claimingTimeLeft`  = `1_734_004_800` + `15_724_800` - **`1749713876` = `15_724`**
- Above we assume that the current block.timestamp is `1749713876` or just above 4 hours before the claiming time left passes.

This would result in: 

`uint256 taxFee = $.maxChargeableTax.mulDiv(claimingTimeLeft, AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH);` 

Or

`uint256 taxFee` = 1_000 * 15_724 / 15_724_800 = 0;`

This is assuming that the `maxChargeableTax` is 1_000 (or around 10%), if the tax is for example 5% or 500, this would increase the time that tax can be manipulated to double, or 8+ hours, and so on. 

And if we have a number as low as 1% for example, this would cause the airdrop to be “claimable”, i.e. users to pay 0 tax, almost 2 days prior to the deadline expiration.

Since `taxFee` is 0, the `claimTaxAmount` would also be 0 due to: 

`claimTaxAmount = claimerUsd0PPBalance.mulDiv(taxFee, BASIS_POINT_BASE);` 

Or

`claimTaxAmount`  = 100_000e18 (example balance) * 0 / 10_000 = 0;

### Internal pre-conditions

Depending on the maxChargeableTax set, due to precision loss, a user’s airdrop will be prematurely available up to 2 days before the expiration date, without paying any tax due to precision loss.

### External pre-conditions

User hasn’t “rage-quit” the airdrop by early unlocking their bonds;

### Attack Path

- Malicious user calls the `payTaxAmount` function 2 days prior to the expiration of the airdrop vesting period (this is assuming that the tax is set at 1%);
- Due to precision loss, the user’s tax is calculated at 0;
- They don’t transfer any Usd0++ while at the same time their `taxedClaimers` status is set to true;
- They claim all of the funds without paying any tax, 2 days prior to the vesting period is finished;

### Impact

Depending on the tax % set up for the airdrop tax, users can pay 0 tax up to 2 days before the deadline expiration and claim the fully vested amount of the airdrop.

### PoC

The `mulDiv` function in the Math.sol lib can be utilized to test the above mentioned scenarios and observe the precision loss:

```solidity
    function test1(uint256 taxPercentage, uint256 timeLeft)public pure returns (uint256){
        return mulDiv(taxPercentage, timeLeft, 15_724_800);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Make sure that this scenario is accounted for when it comes to precision loss by adding 1 wei if the result is 0 but vesting hasn't fully finished yet.
