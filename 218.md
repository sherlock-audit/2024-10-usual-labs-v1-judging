# Allocations removed will be locked in the contract with no way to recover

### Summary

Missing token recovery mechanism in `removeOriginalAllocation` will cause permanent loss of funds for allocation recipients as USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE can remove allocations without transferring or sweeping the unclaimed tokens, leaving them stuck in the contract.

### Root Cause

In UsualSP.sol:`removeOriginalAllocation`, the function zeroes out allocations without handling the underlying tokens:

```solidity
function removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients) external {
        if (recipients.length == 0) {
            revert InvalidInputArraysLength();
        }

        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE);

        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
            $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
            $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;

            emit RemovedOriginalAllocation(recipients[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

Balances are zero now but what about the tokens? Without a function as "sweep", these tokens are not allocated now, untracked, stuck in the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to have an `originalAllocation` greater than 0
2. `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` needs to call `removeOriginalAllocation`

### External pre-conditions

1. User didn't claim the allocation yet


### Attack Path

1. User A is allocated 1000 USUALS tokens
2. User A has claimed 0 USUALS tokens
3. `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` calls `removeOriginalAllocation` with User A's address
4. User A's `originalAllocation` and `originalClaimed` are set to 0
5. The remaining 1000 USUALS tokens are now permanently stuck in the contract with no way to recover them

### Impact

These tokens will become unallocated and permanently locked in the contract with no mechanism to recover them

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add token recovery mechanism like sweeping or transferring removed allocations to treasury
