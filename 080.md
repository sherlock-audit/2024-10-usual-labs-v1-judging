### Summary

    https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L319

in the withdraw function in usualx.sol the call to make the withdraw is made before collecting the fee, which can lead to user not paying any fee
the protocol can not deduct the fee if the user have withdrawn all the asset
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
        public
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        YieldDataStorage storage yieldStorage = _getYieldDataStorage();

        // Check withdrawal limit
        uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
        }
        // Calculate shares needed
        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

        // Perform withdrawal (exact assets to receiver)
        super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);

        // take the fee
 @> yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;

### Root Cause

in usual.sol in the  withdrawal function the fee is supposed to be deducted before before calling the parent function to transfer the assets to the user

### Internal pre-conditions

if the user should withdraw all his asset the will be no fee for the protocol to deduct

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

user call withdraw function and the function will make sure user are not withdrawing more than their maxasset then it calculate the fee based on the amount the user wants to withdraw, then it calls the parent function to perform the withdraw logic(transfer assets to users) before deducting the fee

### Impact

since the withdraw function makes the withdraw(transfer assets to users) before deducting fee, a bad user can simple avoid paying the fees by withdrawing all their asset, making the protocol unable to deduct the fee since the will be no asset left

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

the protocol should ensure the deduct the fee first before making the transfer
