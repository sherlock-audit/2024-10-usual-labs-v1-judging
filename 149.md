# Unauthorized Claim Execution by External Parties Due to Lack of Sender Verification in `AirdropDistribution.sol` contract.

### Summary

Lack of verification of the senderâ€™s address in the `AirdropDistribution::claim(address account, bool isTop80, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof)`  `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L314C4-L341C6` function will cause an unauthorized claim execution for the intended claimant as any external actor with access to the Merkle proof and account information can call claim on behalf of the claimant without consent, potentially leading to unintended fund distribution.
  ###
### Root Cause

The design choice to use the same Merkle root for the entire six-month's claim is a mistake as it exposes the claim function to unauthorized access. Specifically, it allows any actor with initial access to the Merkle proof (since it remains constant for the full claimable amount over multiple months, they can acces it from on chain data once the claimant uses the `claim` function first time) to repeatedly execute unauthorized claims. This static approach to the Merkle root fails to limit access to valid claimants over time, enabling potential exploitation where malicious actors could claim on behalf of other accounts, even if those accounts do not intend to claim. Consequently, tokens would be minted for those accounts without their consent, leading to an unintentional distribution of funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. After the end of `FIRST_AIRDROP_VESTING_CLAIMING_DATE` , the claimant calls `claim(address account, bool isTop80, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof)` with the necessary arguments.
2. After the end of `SECOND_AIRDROP_VESTING_CLAIMING_DATE` the claimant doesnt not call the `claim` function as he does not want to claim at that point.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious actor sees the on chain data of the first claim transaction and uses the same arguments used by claimant during first claim and calls `claim(address account, bool isTop80, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof)` with the claimant's data as arguments after `SECOND_AIRDROP_VESTING_CLAIMING_DATE`
2. Then the `ususal` token will be minted for the claimant even though he does not want to claim at that point.

### Impact

The users may suffer unexpected consequences if an unauthorized claim is made on their behalf. Potential impacts include:

	1.	Tax Liabilities: Users may incur unwanted tax obligations if claims are processed prematurely, affecting their financial planning.
	2.	Privacy Exposure: Users may prefer to avoid immediate on-chain visibility, and unauthorized claims compromise their privacy.
	3.	Increased Security Risks: Premature claims could draw attention to their wallets, increasing potential security vulnerabilities.
