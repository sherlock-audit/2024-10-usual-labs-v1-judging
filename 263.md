# Error in calculation of shares to be burned in the course of withdrawal leads to error in withdrawal fee calculation

## Impact
### Summary 
Users can withdraw their tokens from the protocol using the `UsualX::withdraw` function. During function execution, the protocol calculates the number of shares to be burned from the user which is equivalent to the amount of tokens to be withdrawn plus a withdrawal fee as set by the protocol.
Unfortunately, the withdrawal fee is wrongly calculated which leads to over or under calculation of the amount to be withdrawn by the user.

### Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability lies in the `UsualX::previewWithdraw` function which is called by the `UsualX::withdraw` function during execution. The `UsualX::previewWithdraw` function calculates the amount of shares to be burned from a user in the course of fulfilling a withdrawal application.
In particular, the `UsualX::previewWithdraw` function calculates the withdrawal fee in a wrong way by multiplying the `assets` by the `withdrawalFeeBps` and dividing by `BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps`. Note that because the function divides by `BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps`, it gives a higher result as compared to when the numerator is divided by `BASIS_POINT_BASE`. Therefore, in theory, the user is charged more withdrawal fees than necessary.

```javascript
      function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
        public
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        YieldDataStorage storage yieldStorage = _getYieldDataStorage();


        // Check withdrawal limit
        uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
        }
        // Calculate shares needed
        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);


        // Perform withdrawal (exact assets to receiver)
        super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);


        // take the fee
        yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
    }

```

```javascript
      function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares) {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        // Calculate the fee based on the equivalent assets of these shares
        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
            assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil
        );
        // Calculate total assets needed, including fee
        uint256 assetsWithFee = assets + fee;


        // Convert the total assets (including fee) to shares
        shares = _convertToShares(assetsWithFee, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    }

```


### Impact
Due to error in calculation of withdrawal fee caused by inacurrate calculation of shares to be burned by the `UsualX::previewWithdraw` function, users will be charged more withdrawal fee than it is set in the protocol leading to loss of user tokens.
Furthermore, as demonstrated in the proof of code below, a user who withdraws in batches rather than in one withdrawal application ends up paying less withdrawal fee than is set in the protocol. This way, the protocol losses withdrawal fees.

## Proof of Concept
Let four users deposit the same amount of tokens into the protocol and attempt to withdraw their tokens afterward i.e. `alice`, `bob`, `songrit` and `maritji`.
Secondly, let the protocol set 25% as the withdrawal fee for demonstration purpose.
These users attempt to withdraw in the following sequence:
1. `alice` attempts to withdraw in two batches. In the first attempt, `alice` withdraws a fraction of deposited tokens while the remaining balance is withdrawn in the second attempt.
2. `bob` attempts to withdraw all their token i.e. maxWithraw in one attempt. `songrit` and `maritji` follow the same pattern as `bob` in that order.
3. The below proof of code shows that `alice` ends up paying less than 25% withdrawal fee in total; `bob` and `songrit` pay more than 25% withdrawal fee each with `songrit` paying more in withdrawal fee than `bob`; `maritji` does not pay any withdrawal fee at all, withdrawing all her deposited tokens.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider modifying the `UsualX::previewWithdraw` function to divide by `BASIS_POINT_BASE` instead of dividing by `BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps`.

```diff
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares) {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        // Calculate the fee based on the equivalent assets of these shares
-        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
-            assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil
-        );
+        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
+            assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil
+        );
        // Calculate total assets needed, including fee
        uint256 assetsWithFee = assets + fee;


        // Convert the total assets (including fee) to shares
        shares = _convertToShares(assetsWithFee, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    }
```
*Disclaimer:* the above recommendation only gives a partial solution in the sense that after applying this recommendation, `bob` and `songrit` now pay exactly 25% as withdrawal fee while the situation is still the same for `alice` and `maritji`.
