# Lack of access control in `AirdropDistribution::claim()` leads to loss of funds for the user

### Summary

`AirdropDistribution` is a contract that is used to manage the airdrop distribution of `USUAL` token. The distribution is handled using merkle tree. The user can claim his tokens by calling `claim` function with correct input data that is used to verify user's claimable amount. The distribution period lasts 6 months and there are a two types of claimers. The normal user which is allowed to claim the total amount without vesting period and the `top80` user which can claim part of the total amount monthly. For users that have to follow the vesting period ( top80% no tax paid ) can claim monthly with no penalty if they behave correctly ( the Penalty System Implements an admin-only penalty system based on off-chain criteria ). When `top80` calls `claim` after the first month the hash and the inputs are visible to everyone and can be used to `claim` on behalf of the user. The issue is that it can be called in the moment, when the penalty will be applied to the user and he will lose part of his tokens.

### Root Cause

There is no access control in `claim` function. When the inputs are publicly known anyone can call this function at any time. It can lead to loss of funds if the user has set `penaltyPercentageByMonth`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Penalty precentage must be set for `top80` user.

### External pre-conditions

1. Inputs must be known (it is possible for example when user calls the `claim` function after first month which is expected scenario by the design of the protocol).

### Attack Path

1. `top80` user calls `claim` function during distribution period
2. Attacker calls `claim` on behalf of the user which results in lost funds in form of the penalty. User might wanted to wait until the penalty is no longer applied to his address but the attacker called `claim` function and the user lost part of his tokens not by his choice.

### Impact

User can lose up to 100% of the monthly airdrop depending on the penalty procentage set by protocol.

### PoC

There is no access control in `claim` function. Anyone can call it after the inputs are known.

```javascript
function claim(address account, bool isTop80, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
    {
        if (account == address(0)) {
            revert NullAddress();
        }
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert AmountIsZero();
        }

        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $ = _airdropDistributionStorageV0();

        if (!_verifyMerkleProof($, account, isTop80, amount, proof)) {
            revert InvalidProof();
        }

        if ($.ragequit[account]) {
            revert AirdropVoided();
        }

        (uint256 amountToClaim, uint256 penaltyAmount) = _available($, account, amount, isTop80);

        $.claimed[account] += amountToClaim + penaltyAmount;
        $.usualToken.mint(account, amountToClaim);
        emit Claimed(account, amountToClaim);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Add access control in `claim` function that ensures the caller of the function is the `account` address.
