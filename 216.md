# the _burnStableTokenAndTransferCollateral is broken and will lead to a loss of funds for users

### Summary

when redeem function is called the redeem function calls _burnStableTokenAndTransferCollateral to handle the transfer of collateral tokens back to users

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L743


    function _burnStableTokenAndTransferCollateral(
        address rwaToken,
        uint256 stableAmount,
        uint256 stableFee
    ) internal returns (uint256 returnedCollateral) {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        // we burn the remaining stable token
        uint256 burnedStable = stableAmount - stableFee;
        // we burn all the stable token USD0
        $.usd0.burnFrom(msg.sender, stableAmount);


        // get the amount of collateral token for the amount of stablecoin burned by calling the oracle
        returnedCollateral = _getTokenAmountForAmountInUSD(burnedStable, rwaToken);
        if (returnedCollateral == 0) {
            revert AmountTooLow();
        }


        // we distribute the collateral token from the treasury to the user
        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20
        IERC20Metadata(rwaToken).safeTransferFrom($.treasury, msg.sender, returnedCollateral);
    }

this function calls _getTokenAmountForAmountInUSD to get the amount the user should receive and reverts if amount received is 0 the function reverts. the  function calls  _getQuoteInToken  which calls oracle to get the amount of token for an amount of stable

however the problematic part is this

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L586

this burns the stable balance of user before calling _getTokenAmountForAmountInUSD if the amount returned by this call is 0 due to oracle errors or whatever reason which is very common the users balance will already be burned and the function will revert leading to a loss of funds for user  

### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

oracle returns 0 

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

users loses his entire fund 

### PoC

user calls redeem to redeem his tokens for stable
function calls transferandburnstable
transferandburnstable burns the users stable then makes a call to _getQuoteInToken
_getQuoteInToken returns 0 and the function reverts
users balance is already burned leading to a loss of funds

### Mitigation

check if the amount returned by oracle is not 0 before burning any user balance
