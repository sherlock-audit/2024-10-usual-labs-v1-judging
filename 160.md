# Lack of cheks for token decimals higher than 18 decimals

### Summary

The `_transferFee` function in` DaoCollateral.sol` calculates and normalizes fees based on the tokenâ€™s decimal places if they are less than 18 decimals. However, it does not handle tokens with `more than 18 decimals,` e.g YamV2 which may lead to incorrect fee calculations for these tokens. By expanding the normalization logic, _transferFee can accommodate tokens with decimals greater than 18, ensuring accurate fee calculations regardless of token precision.

### Impact

Incorrect Fee Calculations: Tokens with more than 18 decimals will not be properly handled by the existing normalization logic, which could result in excessive or insufficient fees.

### PoC

The _transferFee function only adjusts fees if tokenDecimals < 18, which does not account for tokens with tokenDecimals > 18. Such tokens will bypass the normalization step, leading to inaccurate fee assessments.
```javascript
function _transferFee(uint256 usd0Amount, address rwaToken)
    internal
    returns (uint256 stableFee)
{
    DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
    stableFee = Math.mulDiv(usd0Amount, $.redeemFee, SCALAR_TEN_KWEI, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    uint8 tokenDecimals = IERC20Metadata(rwaToken).decimals();

    // Current code only normalizes if decimals are less than 18
    if (tokenDecimals < 18) {
        stableFee = Normalize.tokenAmountToWad(
            Normalize.wadAmountToDecimals(stableFee, tokenDecimals), tokenDecimals
        );
    }

    if (stableFee > 0) {
        $.usd0.mint($.treasury, stableFee);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Expand the normalization logic to include adjustments for tokens with both less than and more than 18 decimals. This way, the function can calculate the appropriate stableFee for tokens with any decimal precision.
