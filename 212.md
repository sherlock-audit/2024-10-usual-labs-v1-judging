# Removed allocations will be stuck in UsualSP.sol, diluting reward rates

### Summary

Missing token recovery in `removeOriginalAllocation` will cause incorrect reward calculations for all users as `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` can create unallocated tokens that still count in `totalStaked()`, diluting the reward rate for all users.

### Root Cause

In UsualSP.sol, `totalStaked`() returns the total balance of USUALS in the contract:
UsualSP.sol
```solidity
function totalStaked() public view override returns (uint256) {
    UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
    return $.usualS.balanceOf(address(this));
}
```

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        return
            $.liquidAllocation[account] + $.originalAllocation[account] - $.originalClaimed[account];
    }
```
However, when allocations are removed without reallocating, these unallocated tokens still count in `totalStaked`(), causing the reward rate per token to be calculated using an inflated total supply.

When allocation is removed without transferring tokens:

1. `totalStaked`() includes stuck tokens (higher denominator)
2. This makes `rewardPerToken` calculation smaller
3. When calculating earned, this smaller rate is multiplied by user's `balanceOf`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Users need to have active allocations with unclaimed tokens
2. Reward distribution needs to be active (`rewardRate` > 0)
3. `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` needs to call `removeOriginalAllocation`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Contract has 1000 USUALS tokens allocated across users
2. Reward distribution is active at 100 token per day
3. `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` removes allocation for 500 USUALS without reallocating
4. `totalStaked`() still returns 1000 USUALS
5. Rewards are distributed based on 1000 total tokens, but only 500 are actually allocated
6. Users receive fewer rewards than they should because of the inflated total supply

### Impact

All users receive reduced rewards because the reward rate calculation uses an inflated total supply that includes unallocated tokens. The reduction in rewards is proportional to the amount of unallocated tokens in the contract.

### PoC

Please add this test to UsualSP.t.sol and run: forge test --match-test test_RewardDilutionAfterRemoveAllocation

```solidity
function test_RewardDilutionAfterRemoveAllocation() public {
        // Setup initial allocations
        address[] memory recipients = new address[](2);
        recipients[0] = alice;
        recipients[1] = bob;
        uint256[] memory allocations = new uint256[](2);
        allocations[0] = 500e18;
        allocations[1] = 500e18;
        uint256[] memory cliffDurations = new uint256[](2);
        cliffDurations[0] = 0; // No cliff for Alice
        cliffDurations[1] = 0; // No cliff for Bob

        // Mock the UsualS balance to match our test scenario
        vm.mockCall(
            address(usualS),
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.balanceOf.selector, address(usualSP)),
            abi.encode(1000e18) // Set total staked to match our allocations
        );

        setupVesting(recipients, allocations, cliffDurations);

        // Skip some time to allow vesting to start
        skip(ONE_MONTH); // Add this line to ensure vesting has started

        // Start reward distribution
        uint256 rewardAmount = 100e18;
        deal(address(usualToken), address(distributionModule), rewardAmount);
        vm.startPrank(address(distributionModule));
        usualToken.approve(address(usualSP), rewardAmount);
        usualSP.startRewardDistribution(rewardAmount, block.timestamp, block.timestamp + 1 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Mock the UsualS balance again before removing Bob's allocation
        vm.mockCall(
            address(usualS),
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.balanceOf.selector, address(usualSP)),
            abi.encode(1000e18) // Maintain the same total staked amount
        );

        // Remove bob's allocation
        address[] memory toRemove = new address[](1);
        toRemove[0] = bob;
        vm.prank(usualSPOperator);
        usualSP.removeOriginalAllocation(toRemove);

        // Verify total staked includes removed allocation
        assertEq(usualSP.totalStaked(), 1000e18); // Still includes bob's 500e18

        // Fast forward and let alice claim rewards
        skip(1 days);
        vm.prank(alice);
        uint256 aliceReward = usualSP.claimReward();

        // Alice gets half of rewards despite being only active user
        assertApproxEqAbs(aliceReward, rewardAmount / 2, 1e18);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Ensure all removed allocations are either reallocated or returned to treasury to maintain accurate total supply for reward calculations.
