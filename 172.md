# A user with 29 day cliff period set has actually 0 days of cliff period

### Summary

A calculation error in the cliff duration logic will cause incorrect vesting calculations for insiders as `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` can set cliff durations less than one month, which results in `totalMonthsInCliffDuration` being 0 due to integer division, which also enables immediate claiming in parallel.

### Root Cause


In `UsualSP.sol:_released()`, the calculation `uint256 totalMonthsInCliffDuration = insiderCliffDuration / ONE_MONTH;` will return 0 if `insiderCliffDuration` is set to less than `ONE_MONTH` (30 days). This is because Solidity performs integer division and rounds down.
Therefore, waiting 1 days and waiting 29 days will be the same with this calculation method.

```solidity
function _released(UsualSPStorageV0 storage $, address insider) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 insiderCliffDuration = $.cliffDuration[insider];
    
    uint256 totalMonthsInCliffDuration = insiderCliffDuration / ONE_MONTH;
    // @audit if insiderCliffDuration is set less than one month, it will return 0
    uint256 totalAllocation = $.originalAllocation[insider];
    
    // ... rest of function
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` needs to call `allocate`() with a `cliffDuration` value less than `ONE_MONTH` (30 days), which is possible to execute

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` calls `allocate`() with a cliff duration of less than 30 days (e.g., 29 day) for an insider
2. After `startDate` + 29 day, the insider can call `claimOriginalAllocation`()
3. The vesting calculation uses `totalMonthsInCliffDuration` = 0, which when plugged into the formula:
```solidity
vestedAmount = totalAllocation.mulDiv(
    totalMonthsInCliffDuration + monthsPassed,
    NUMBER_OF_MONTHS_IN_THREE_YEARS,
    Math.Rounding.Floor
);
```
allows immediate claiming of tokens, bypassing the intended cliff period schedule

### Impact

The cliff mechanism is broken due to two compounding issues when `insiderCliffDuration` is less than `ONE_MONTH`:
The cliff check `if (block.timestamp < $.startDate + insiderCliffDuration)` can be bypassed with just 1 second of waiting when insiderCliffDuration is set to a time less than 1 month.
The vesting calculation breaks because `totalMonthsInCliffDuration = insiderCliffDuration / ONE_MONTH` becomes 0, which when used in the formula:
```solidity
vestedAmount = totalAllocation.mulDiv(
    totalMonthsInCliffDuration + monthsPassed,  // starts with 0
    NUMBER_OF_MONTHS_IN_THREE_YEARS,
    Math.Rounding.Floor
);
```

Cliff logic is broken

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check in the `allocate`() function to ensure cliff durations are at least one month
Or change the calculation method
