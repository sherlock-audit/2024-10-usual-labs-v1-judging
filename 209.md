# Griefing first depositor attack in UsualX vault.


### Summary
 
UsualX doesn't override default openzeppelin's ERC4626Upgradeable's `decimalsOffset` making it vulnerable to griefing inflation attack which renders the vaults completely unusable.

### Root Cause

UsualX is [YieldBearingVault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L51) which is [ERC4626Upgradeable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/YieldBearingVault.sol#L14) contract. 

```solidity
contract UsualX is
    YieldBearingVault,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    EIP712Upgradeable
{
```

```solidity
abstract contract YieldBearingVault is ERC4626Upgradeable {
```

Going through the contract, we cna see that the `decimalsOffset` is 0, unchanged from the [default](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/723f8cab09cdae1aca9ec9cc1cfa040c2d4b06c1/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L308) implementation

```solidity
    function _decimalsOffset() internal view virtual returns (uint8) {
        return 0;
    }
```
### Internal pre-conditions
Empty or near empty vault.

### External pre-conditions
_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker front-run first depositor's transaction by depositing `1` asset to vault.
2. Attacker then donates osToken `2*X - 1` assets to the vault where X is the amount that the first depositor wants to deposit.
3. First depositor transaction mint him 0 shares, because `_convertToShares` rounds down

As a result, the first depositor loses `X` assets.
 
### Impact

* The first depositor loses `X` assets
* The attacker loses `1/2*X` assets
 
This attack is a griefing attack, but the loss of the user is greater than the loss of the attacker.
 

### PoC
_No response_
 
### Mitigation

Implement `minAmountShares` variable, which should be passed to deposit/mint function, or introduce dead shares.
