# depositWithPermit Restricts Permit Usage to Only msg.sender

### Summary

In the [depositWithPermit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L297C1-L310C1) function, the first parameter in the permit call is set to msg.sender. This implementation inadvertently limits the function to only allow the account that created the permit signature (msg.sender) to execute the transaction. However, the intended flexibility of the permit function is to enable any external party to submit an already-signed permit on behalf of the owner, allowing greater flexibility in asset management. This restriction limits the function's usability by preventing third-party interactions.

### Root Cause

In the current [depositWithPermit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L297C1-L310C1)  function, the code calls permit as follows:
`IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), assets, deadline, v, r, s);
`
The external Permit is implemented as follows:
```solidity
function permit(
    address owner,
    address spender,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
) public virtual {
    ...
    address signer = ECDSA.recover(hash, v, r, s);
    if (signer != owner) {
        revert ERC2612InvalidSigner(signer, owner);
    }
    _approve(owner, spender, value);
}
```
This permit implementation verifies that the signer matches the provided owner address, which should ideally allow any account (or contract) to call permit with a valid off-chain signature from owner. However, by hardcoding msg.sender as the owner in depositWithPermit, only the permit creator (i.e., msg.sender) can complete the transaction.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- User A (the owner) signs a permit for User B, enabling B to call depositWithPermit on User A's behalf.
- User B attempts to call depositWithPermit to deposit assets on behalf of User A using the signed permit.
- The transaction reverts because depositWithPermit sets owner to msg.sender (User B), whereas the permit function expects signer to match owner (User A).

This limitation prevents User B from completing the transaction for User A, defeating the primary purpose of using permit.

### Impact

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the depositWithPermit function to accept an additional owner parameter instead of hardcoding msg.sender. This enables flexibility for third parties to submit permits on behalf of others.
