# Last depositor may not be able to withdraw due to rounding up

### Summary
The withdraw fee calculated in previewWithdraw() is rounded up which may leave final share holder unable to withdraw all their funds

### Root Cause
Fee is added to, rather than deducted from, `assets`

### Internal pre-conditions
Withdrawer must have shares in the `UsualX` vault and be the last share holder
Vault must have a `Usual` balance

### External pre-conditions
No response

### Attack Path
Because [previewWithdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L393-L404) uses rounding up when calculating the withdraw fee a user must pay and adds that value to the users requested assets a final share holder may not be able to wiythdraw all their assets.

```solidity
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares) {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        // Calculate the fee based on the equivalent assets of these shares
        // @audit : fee rounds up
>>>     uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
>>>         assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil
        );
        // Calculate total assets needed, including fee
        uint256 assetsWithFee = assets + fee;

        // Convert the total assets (including fee) to shares
        shares = _convertToShares(assetsWithFee, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    }

```

Say there are 100 assets in the vault and final share holder has 100 shares.
User requests `assets` which takes fees into account but due to rounding up there is an off by one error which means they canlt withdraw

### Impact
USer cannot withdraw all their assets breaking core functionality

### Mitigation
Deduct fees from total assets rather than addign similar to how its done in `redeem()`
