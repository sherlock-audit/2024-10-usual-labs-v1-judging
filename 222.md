# Governance can arbitrarily burn $USUAL Token from any address

###  SUMMARY

Governance can burn any amount of `$USUAL Token` from any address.

Unlike `$USUAL Token` which is minted when users deposit $USUAL Asset and burned when users withdraw, the `burn` function in the governance token `Usual.sol` is unnecessary and open up the risk of malicious/compromised governance burning user's token.

Here is the reference code:

### IMPACT

I will consider this an high risk because the protocol is open to a malicious act resulting in users losing their tokens.

### TOOLS USED

Manual Review

### RECOMMENDED MITIGATION STEPS

Consider removing the function, or modify the burn function so it only allows `msg.sender` to burn the token:

`functionburn(uint256 amount) public {
        UsualStorageV0 storage $ = _usualStorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(USUAL_BURN);
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }`
