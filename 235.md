# Partial Unwrapping of USD0PP Tokens Permanently Blocks Access to Remaining Airdrop Claims

### Summary

The `voidAnyOutstandingAirdrop` function in `AirdropDistribution.sol` is called during USD0PP unwrapping, which permanently blocks users from claiming their remaining airdrop allocation even when performing partial unwraps. This creates a "DOS" situation where users must choose between unwrapping any amount of USD0PP or maintaining their ability to claim airdrops.

## Details
The issue manifests in the interaction between three key components:

The USD0PP unwrapping mechanism:
`airdropContract.voidAnyOutstandingAirdrop(msg.sender);`

The airdrop voiding function:
```solidity
function voidAnyOutstandingAirdrop(address account) external {
    if ($.ragequit[account]) {
        revert AirdropVoided();
    }
    $.ragequit[account] = true;
    emit Ragequit(account);
}
```

The claim function's ragequit check:
```solidity
if ($.ragequit[account]) {
    revert AirdropVoided();
}
```

This creates a critical flaw in the system's tokenomics where:

- Partial unwrapping triggers complete airdrop forfeiture
- No mechanism exists to partially void airdrops
- Users cannot reverse or modify ragequit status
- The penalty is disproportionate to the action taken

## Illustration

Scenario:

- Alice has 1,000 USD0PP tokens
- Airdrop eligibility: 1,000 USUAL tokens
- Alice unwraps 100 USD0PP (10%)

Result:

- Gets 100 USD0 tokens
- Loses access to ALL 1,000 USUAL tokens
- Cannot claim remaining 900 USUAL tokens
- No partial claim options available

### Root Cause

The fundamental issue stems from the binary nature of the ragequit flag combined with the lack of proportional unwrapping logic. The `voidAnyOutstandingAirdrop` function uses a boolean flag that, once set to true, permanently blocks ALL future claims regardless of the unwrap amount.

### Internal pre-conditions

- User must have USD0PP tokens
- User must be eligible for airdrop claims (valid merkle proof)
- User's account must not have previously ragequit ($.ragequit[account] == false)
- Contract must not be paused
- User must have valid claim amount > 0

### External pre-conditions

- USD0PP contract must be properly registered in the registry contract
- Block timestamp must be after AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME
- Valid merkle root must be set by AIRDROP_OPERATOR_ROLE

### Attack Path

1. User initiates partial unwrap of USD0PP tokens
2. USD0PP contract calls `voidAnyOutstandingAirdrop()`
3. AirdropDistribution sets `ragequit[user] = true`
4. All future claim attempts revert due to AirdropVoided check
5. Remaining airdrop allocation becomes permanently inaccessible

### Impact

High severity due to:

1. Direct Financial Loss.
2. Users lose access to remaining airdrop allocations.
3. Value of forfeited claims could be substantial
4. No recovery mechanism available

**System Design Implications**

1. Forces suboptimal user decisions
2. Creates unnecessary friction in token utility
3. May reduce protocol adoption due to rigid constraints

**Economic Model Disruption**

1. Discourages partial unwrapping
2. Creates artificial pressure to hold USD0PP
3. May lead to market inefficiencies

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a proportional voiding system:

Track unwrapped amounts:
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public unwrappedAmount;
mapping(address => uint256) public totalAllocation;

function voidAnyOutstandingAirdrop(address account, uint256 amount) external {
    unwrappedAmount[account] += amount;
    uint256 remainingPercentage = ((totalAllocation[account] - unwrappedAmount[account]) * 1e18) / totalAllocation[account];
    
    // Update claim eligibility
    claimableAmount = (totalAirdrop * remainingPercentage) / 1e18;
}
```

Implement partial ragequit:
```solidity
struct RagequitInfo {
    uint256 voidedPercentage;
    uint256 lastUpdateTime;
    uint256 totalAllocation;
}

mapping(address => RagequitInfo) public ragequitData;

function partialRagequit(address account, uint256 unwrapAmount) external {
    RagequitInfo storage info = ragequitData[account];
    uint256 voidPercentage = (unwrapAmount * 1e18) / info.totalAllocation;
    info.voidedPercentage += voidPercentage;
    info.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
    
    emit PartialRagequit(account, voidPercentage, unwrapAmount);
}
```

Add claim adjustments:
```solidity
function calculateClaimableAmount(address account, uint256 totalAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    RagequitInfo storage info = ragequitData[account];
    uint256 remainingPercentage = 1e18 - info.voidedPercentage;
    return (totalAmount * remainingPercentage) / 1e18;
}
```
