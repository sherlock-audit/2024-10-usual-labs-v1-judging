# Partial Unwrap Limitation Causes Permanent Locking of Remaining Airdrop Balance

### Summary

Although the function [`temporaryOneToOneExitUnwrap`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0PP.sol#L261) is intended to support partial unwrapping through the `amountToUnwrap` parameter, the current implementation inadvertently prevents this. Attempts to unwrap a partial amount result in the remaining balance being permanently locked and unrecoverable.


### Root Cause

In `AirdropDistribution.sol` the [voidAnyOutstandingAirdrop function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L419-L421) only allows ragequit for an account once and also even though the [`allocateEarlyUnlockBalance function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0PP.sol#L301) is called for the user to increase there `bondEarlyUnlockAllowedAmount` the user will still be unable to unwrap.

### Attack Path

1. First transaction: Can unwrap any amount up to their allowed amount.
2. Subsequent transactions: Will fail because the user already [ragequit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L419-L421).

### Impact

- Users cannot split their unwrapping into multiple transactions.
- Forces users to unwrap their entire position at once.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Either unwrap all user `bondEarlyUnlockAllowedAmount` and remove the param
