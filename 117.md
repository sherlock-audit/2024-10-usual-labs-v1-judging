# Users are vulnerable to slippage loss when interacting with `UsualX` contract

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

Per the [Possible Attack Vectors](https://usual.gitbook.io/usual-technical-documentation/Aw3jUdIChYIRnEPcqUqK/smart-contracts/protocol-contracts/usual-staking#possible-attack-vectors) section of the Usual Technical Documentation, the following is documented related [`UsualX`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol) contract:

> 1. **Sandwich Attacks**:
>
> - The contract implements both `deposit` and `mint` functions, allowing users to choose between them to mitigate slippage risks.
> - `deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)`: Allows a user to deposit a specific amount of assets and receive shares in return.
> - `mint(uint256 shares, address receiver)`: Allows a user to specify the exact number of shares they want to receive and deposit the corresponding amount of assets.
> - This would happen if a user:
>   1. An attacker could front-run a `deposit` transaction with their own deposit, temporarily inflating the share:asset ratio.
>   2. The victim's deposit would receive fewer shares than expected.
> - Mitigation:
>   - Users can use the `mint` function to specify the exact number of shares they expect to receive.

It was observed that the mitigation for the slippage risk within the Usual Staking ([`UsualX`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L50)) contract is to use the `mint` function as per the above documentation. However, this is incorrect, as having a mint function or having the user use a `mint` function does not mitigate slippage risks.

Assume Bob grants max allowance to the Usual Staking contract (common scenario) and intends to mint 10000 USUALS shares.

Assume that the price of one USUALX share is 1.5 USUAL tokens at this point. Thus, Bob is prepared to pay 15000 USUAL in exchange for 10000 USUALX shares. Bob follows the instructions in the Usual Technical Documentation, and executes the `mint()` function with `shares` parameter set to `10000e18`.

Unfortunately, someone (can be with or without malicious intention because anyone can deposit anytime) deposited before Bob, resulting in an increase in price. As a result, the price of USUALX increases from 1.5 to 2.0 when Bob's deposit transaction is executed. Thus, Bob ended up paying 20000 USUAL and lost 5000 USUAL due to slippage despite following the instructions in the Usual Technical Documentation.
