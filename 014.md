# Anyone can change the implementation contract as `_authorizeUpgrade` access control was not implemented

### Summary

Several contracts in the Usual project inherit UUPSUpgradeable but do not override `_authorizeUpgrade()` to enforce access control. This omission allows any user to modify the implementation contract, creating a critical vulnerability across multiple contracts:

OpenZeppelinâ€™s UUPSUpgradeable documentation states that _authorizeUpgrade() must be overridden with access restrictions:
```solidity
 * The {_authorizeUpgrade} function must be overridden to include access restriction to the upgrade mechanism.
```

In these contracts, this function has not been overridden, leaving the upgrade mechanism open to unauthorized modifications.


### Root Cause

The root cause is the absence of access control in `_authorizeUpgrade()` for contracts inheriting UUPSUpgradeable. This means any user can call this function and modify the implementation, potentially replacing it with a malicious contract.


### Internal pre-conditions

No additional pre-conditions. The code as it is can be upgraded by anyone as soon as it is deployed.


### External pre-conditions

A malicious actor changes the contract implementation.


### Attack Path

1. The attacker identifies the affected contracts.
2. The attacker calls the `upgradeToAndCall()` function, setting the implementation to a malicious contract.
3. The malicious contract could include logic to self-destruct and/ or to steal users funds.


### Impact

This vulnerability allows an unauthorized user to change the implementation contract, which could:
* Lead to the complete destruction of the main proxy contract by calling `selfdestruct()`, erasing all storage and destroying the functionality.
* Allow the attacker to steal users funds.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Override `_authorizeUpgrade()` to implement access control, restricting it to only authorized addresses (e.g., the contract owner).
