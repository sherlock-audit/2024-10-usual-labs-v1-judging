### Attack Path

After discussion with the protocol team, it was understood that the [`AirdropDistribution.setMerkleRoot`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L349) function could be updated more than once after [`AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/constants.sol#L86) (Dec 12 2024 12:00:00 GMT+0000).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L349

```solidity
File: AirdropDistribution.sol
347:     /// @notice Sets the merkle root for the distribution module.
348:     /// @param _merkleRoot The merkle root.
349:     function setMerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external {
350:         if (_merkleRoot == bytes32(0)) {
351:             revert NullMerkleRoot();
352:         }
353:         AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $ = _airdropDistributionStorageV0();
354:         $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(AIRDROP_OPERATOR_ROLE);
355:         $.merkleRoot = _merkleRoot;
356:         emit MerkleRootSet(_merkleRoot);
357:     }
```

Assume that in the initial Merkle root posted on-chain, Bob is entitled to 600 USUAL tokens vested over 6 months. He is also subject to a 50% penalty every month, as shown below.

`$.claimed[Bob] = 0`

| Date          | Jan 25 | Feb 25 | Mar 25 | Apr 25 | May 25 | Jun 25 |
| ------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Vested Amount | 100    | 100    | 100    | 100    | 100    | 100    |
| Penalty       | 50%    | 50%    | 50%    | 50%    | 50%    | 50%    |

At T0 (on March 2025), the protocol decided to increase Bob's entitled airdrop USUAL tokens from 600 to 6000 and submit an `AirdropDistribution.setMerkleRoot` transaction with the new Merkle root to the mempool.

Either of the following events could happen:

1. Bob happens to be also executing the [`AirdropDistribution.claim`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L314) function to claim the vested airdrop for the months of Jan, Feb and Mar 2025 on T0; OR
2. Bob (acting maliciously) saw the protocol's transaction on the mempool, and decided to front-run it with its own [`AirdropDistribution.claim`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L314) transaction because it would allow him to pay the penalty against the existing lower vested amount of 600 compared to the new incoming higher vested amount of 6000.

Either way, it will lead to Bob's `AirdropDistribution.claim` transaction to be executed before the protocol's `AirdropDistribution.setMerkleRoot` transaction.

In this case, Bob will receive 150 USUAL tokens after factoring in the 50% penalty (`100 * 3 * 50%`). After executing the `AirdropDistribution.claim` transaction, the `_computePenalty` function will clear Bob's penalty for the months of Jan, Feb and Mar 2025.

`$.claimed[Bob]` is also updated to `300`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L190

```solidity
File: AirdropDistribution.sol
190:     function _computePenalty(
..SNIP..
195:     ) internal returns (uint256) {
196:         uint256 penaltyAmount = 0;
197:         uint256 oneSixthAmount =
198:             totalAmount.mulDiv(1, AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
199: 
200:         for (uint256 i = 1; i <= monthsPassed; i++) {
..SNIP..
206:                 uint256 monthlyPenalty =
207:                     oneSixthAmount.mulDiv($.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i], BASIS_POINT_BASE);
208:                 penaltyAmount += monthlyPenalty;
209:             }
210:             $.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i] = 0;
211:         }
212:         return penaltyAmount;
213:     }
```

The state becomes as follows at this point.

`$.claimed[Bob] = 300`

| Date          | Jan 25 | Feb 25 | Mar 25 | Apr 25 | May 25 | Jun 25 |
| ------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Vested Amount | 1000   | 1000   | 1000   | 1000   | 1000   | 1000   |
| Penalty       | 0      | 0      | 0      | 50%    | 50%    | 50%    |

At the end of the vesting period (6th month onwards), Bob executes `AirdropDistribution.claim` to claim the remaining USUAL tokens. In this case, Bob will receive 4200 USUAL tokens this time.

```solidity
vested amount = Jan + Feb + Mar + Apr + May + Jun
vested amount = 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + (1000 * 50%) + (1000 * 50%) + (1000 * 50%)
vested amount = 4500

amountToClaim = vested amount - $.claimed[Bob] (amount already claimed)
amountToClaim = 4500 - 300 = 4200
```

In total, Bob received 4500 USUAL tokens (4200 + 300) from the two (2) claims.

The issue is that Bob is subjected to a 50% penalty every month against his total vested amount of 6000. Thus, the maximum amount of USUAL tokens that he is entitled to is only 3000 (`1000 * 50% * 6`). However, in this case, Bob received 4500 USUAL, which is 1500 USUAL more than what he is entitled.

### Impact

- Users can claim more USUAL tokens than expected due to miscalculation in penalty. Bob claimed 1500 more USUAL than expected in the report, which is effectively stealing USUAL tokens from the protocol.

- The protocol receives fewer penalty fees than expected, leading to a loss of funds. In the report, the protocol is supposed to hold 3000 USUAL as a penalty, but due to the miscalculation, only 1500 is withheld.

Severity: High.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When Bob executes the `AirdropDistribution.claim` transaction at T0 (first claim), the calculation is as follows:

- vested amount = 300
- Penalty should be paid  = 150
- `$.claimed[Bob] = 300`
- USUAL minted to Bob = 150
- Penalty paid by Bob = 150

In the correct logic or implementation, when Bob claims the remaining transaction at the end of the vesting period, it should be as follows:

- vested amount = 6000
- Penalty should be paid = 3000 (50% of total vested amount)

In this case, Bob is entitled to only 3000 USUAL after factoring in the penalty of 3000 (`6000 - 3000`)

Since Bob has already received 150 USUAL earlier, he should only receive 2850 USUAL this time around.

```solidity
3000 - 150 = 2850
```
