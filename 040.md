# `UsualX` vault will be unusable, if the distribution period doesn't start immidiately.

### Summary

All calls to `UsualX` will revert, due to underflow in `YieldBearingVault::_calculateEarnedYield()`, for distribution programs that have their `startTiime` in the future.

### Root Cause

In `UsualX`, the yield is distributed in periods that are started calling `UsualX::_startYieldDistribution()`. The distribution "programs" **must** start after the previous "programs" have ended but it is possible to be starting in the future. Let's see the implementation of `UsualX::_startYieldDistribution()` :
```solidity
    function _startYieldDistribution(uint256 yieldAmount, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime)
        internal
        override
    {
        YieldDataStorage storage $ = _getYieldDataStorage();
        IERC20 _asset = IERC20(asset());
        if (yieldAmount == 0) {
            revert ZeroYieldAmount();
        }
        if (startTime < block.timestamp) {
            revert StartTimeNotInFuture();
        }
        if (endTime <= startTime) {
            revert EndTimeNotAfterStartTime();
        }
        if (startTime < $.periodFinish) {
            revert StartTimeBeforePeriodFinish();
        }
        if (block.timestamp < $.periodFinish) {
            revert CurrentTimeBeforePeriodFinish();
        }

        // ...

        $.yieldRate = newYieldRate;
        $.periodStart = startTime;
        $.periodFinish = endTime;
@>        $.lastUpdateTime = startTime;
        $.isActive = true;
    }
```

After this function call, the distribution program will have been setted in the state of `YieldBearingVault`. However, as we can see in the `YieldBearingVault::_calculateEarnedYield()` which is called by `updateYield()` which is called in **every** interaction of **every** user with the protocol, an underflow error will occur if the `startTime` is in the future, because the `$.lastUpdateTime` is not the `block.timestamp` but the`startTime`.

```solidity
    function _calculateEarnedYield() internal view virtual returns (uint256) {
        YieldDataStorage storage $ = _getYieldDataStorage();
        if (!$.isActive) return 0;
        if (block.timestamp <= $.lastUpdateTime) {
            return 0;
        }
        uint256 endTime = Math.min(block.timestamp, $.periodFinish);
@>        uint256 duration = endTime - $.lastUpdateTime;
        return Math.mulDiv(duration, $.yieldRate, YIELD_PRECISION, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    }
```

As we can see, the `endTime` in this calculation is the `block.timestamp` at most of the times while the `$.lastUpdateTime` which may be in the future, meaning `>` than the `block.timestamp`. This means that all calls will revert until the `block.timestamp` reaches the `startTime` which is out of logic.



### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `startTime` of a distribution to be in the future.

### External pre-conditions

1. The `block.timestamp` to not have reached the `startTime`.

### Attack Path

1. Distribution program is setted to start in the future.
2. User just wants to withdraw his funds for whatever reason. His call will revert due to an underflow.

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that **every** action and call on the `UsualX` wll be reverted until the `block.timestamp` reaches the `startTime`.
