# Stuck Rewards Due to Zero Stake Periods in Fixed-Duration Reward Distribution

### Summary

Missing reward tracking during zero stake periods will cause permanent loss of rewards for the protocol as rewards emitted during these periods become permanently stuck in the contract with no recovery mechanism.


### Root Cause

In RewardAccrualBase.sol at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/modules/RewardAccrualBase.sol#L110 the _rewardPerToken() function returns early when totalStaked() == 0 without accounting for the rewards that continue to be emitted at the fixed rewardRate:
```solidity
if (totalStaked() == 0) {
    return $.rewardPerTokenStored;
}
```

### Attack Path


1. Admin initiates reward distribution with `_startRewardDistribution(rewardAmount, startTime, endTime)`
2. All reward tokens are transferred to contract upfront
3. Users unstake all tokens, making `totalStaked() == 0`
4. During zero-stake period:
   - `rewardRate` continues to emit rewards
   - `_rewardPerToken()` doesn't track these emissions
   - Rewards become permanently stuck
5. Even when new users stake:
   - These rewards cannot be claimed as they weren't tracked in `rewardPerTokenStored`. They can only potentially get their share of remaining time * rewardRate worth of rewards, which is calculated in `  _rewardPerToken()`
   - No admin function exists to recover these tokens



### Impact

The protocol suffers permanent loss of reward tokens proportional to `rewardRate * zeroStakePeriod`. These rewards remain locked in the contract forever as there is no recovery mechanism. For example, if a 10-day reward period of 1000 tokens has 5 days of zero staking, 500 tokens become permanently stuck.
