# UsualSP rewards are diluted because it distributes rewards according to the total supply of UsualS

### Summary

Instead of distributing rewards according to the total amount of staked UsualS, it distributes it according to the total supply of UsualS causing everybody to be diluted by a lot.

### Root Cause

UsualS mints the total supply at initialization in [UsualS.s:121](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualS.sol#L121).
When the admin calls `UsualSP.stakeUsualS()` it will transfer the whole balance of UsualS to UsualSP, see [UsualSP.sol:406](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L406) & [UsualS.sol:194](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualS.sol#L194).

When rewards are distributed in UsualSP, it calculates the reward per token using the `totalStaked()` function, see [RewardAccrualBase.sol:125](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/modules/RewardAccrualBase.sol#L125). And `totalStaked()` is defined as the UsualS balance of UsualSP, see [UsualSP.sol:451](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L451).

So, to sum it up:
- when UsualS is initialized it mints the total supply to itself
- when UsualSP calls `stakeAll()`, it transfers the whole balance of UsualS to itself
- UsualSP uses its UsualS balance as the total staked amount with which to calculate the rewards per token

Meaning, totalStaked is significantly higher than it should be causing all the stakers to be diluted heavily.

In the `setUp()` function of the UsualSP test file we can see that `stakeUsualS()` is supposed to called by the admin before the contract starts operation: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/test/token/UsualSP.t.sol#L54.
