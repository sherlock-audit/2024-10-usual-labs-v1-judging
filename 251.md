# UsualX.col : USer can still deposit assets even when the contract is Paused






### Summary

In the `UsualX` contract , users can still `mint/deposit` assets even when the contract is `paused`.

`whenNotPaused` check is only implimented for `depositWithPermit` and since there are no functions coded to override the inherited virtual functions (`mint() and deposit()`) , they can be called by the users without going through `nonReentrant` or `whenNotPuased` check.

[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L297) shows implementation of `depositWithPermit()`.
`deposit()` and `mint()` are not implemented but the user can call the inheirted function from `ERC20Upgradeable` which is inheited by the abstract contract `yieldBearingVault` which is then inherited by `UsualX`.


### Root Cause

Absence of `overriden` function  `deposit()` and `mint()` in the  `UsualX` contract allows user to call `deposit() or mint() `implemented in the base contract `ERC20Upgradeable` 

### Internal pre-conditions
_No response_


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

USer can` deposit()` assets or `mint()` shares even when the contract is paused.

### PoC
_No response_

### Mitigation

implement an overriden function for deposit and mint with whenNotPaused and nonRentrant check.
