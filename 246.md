# Users can get their airdropped token and their USD0 with incurring almost no losses, in comparison to giving their eligible share of airdropped tokens

### Summary

Airdrop is to be claimed via `claim()`, but users **will be ineligible** if they've called `temporaryOneToOneExitUnwrap()` to get their `USD0` before the end of the bond period.

What a user can do is the following - they can redeem their `USD0PP` tokens via [unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0PP.sol#L432) without forfeiting their airdrop. They'll get the amount of `USD0` depending on the floor price, which will be set to 99.9%.

This means that the user will just have to pay 1/1000 of their `USD0PP` and keep his airdrop share, in comparison to not pay the 1/1000, but forfeiting the airdrop, which will be **significantly more than 1/1000**.

### Root Cause

Lack of any restriction or penalty regarding calling `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice()` with early unlocked USD0PP, making the `temporaryOneToOneExitUnwrap()` totally not practical due to the forfeit of the airdrop amount.

No incentive to NOT call `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice()` making it an obvious choice with losing just 1/1000 and having the airdrop amount as eligible, which will be **much more than the  1/1000 lost:**  
1/1000, because the `INITIAL_FLOOR_PRICE` will be - `999_000_000_000_000_000`.

### Internal pre-conditions

Users are eligible for airdrop and have a key value pair of their address versus USD0PP in `mapping bondEarlyUnlockAllowedAmount`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `Alice` wants to unlock their `USD0PP` for `USD0` without waiting the bond period, but she doesn't want to lose her airdrop eligibility, so she calls `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice()`
2. She then calls `claim()` and claim her portion of the airdrop, partial or full doesn't matter - what matters is that she got her `USD0PP` and she is going to get her airdropped `Usual` tokens as well

### Impact

`temporaryOneToOneExitUnwrap()` will be rendered useless and users will bypass with via `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice()`
