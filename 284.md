# Blacklisted addresses will bypass blacklist restrictions and transfer tokens from users

### Summary

In ``Usd0PP.sol`` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0PP.sol#L526-L540 the _update function is overridden to prevent blacklisted users from interacting with the contract by reverting any transfer involving blacklisted from or to addresses.
However, the transferFrom function does not include a check for msg.sender being blacklisted. This missing check will cause unauthorized token transfers for users, as blacklisted addresses will use existing approvals to transfer tokens despite being blacklisted.

### Root Cause

In ``Usd0PP.sol``, the transferFrom function does not check if msg.sender is blacklisted, allowing blacklisted addresses to initiate token transfers.

### Internal pre-conditions

- A user (user) approves the blacklisted address (hacker) to spend a certain amount of tokens by calling approve(hacker, amount).
- The hacker is added to the blacklist after the approval is made.

### External pre-conditions

Users have been tricked into approving allowances to the blacklisted address through phishing attacks or malicious websites.

### Attack Path

- The user approves the hacker to spend tokens by calling approve(hacker, amount).
- The contract owner adds the hacker to the blacklist.
- Despite being blacklisted, the hacker calls transferFrom(user, hacker2, amount), transferring tokens from the user to another address (hacker2).
- The transfer succeeds because the transferFrom function does not check if msg.sender is blacklisted.

### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss of the tokens they had approved to the blacklisted address. The attacker gains unauthorized access to users' tokens despite being blacklisted, continuing malicious activities and potentially leading to significant financial losses for users.

Furthermore, this vulnerability allows attackers to exploit prior approvals even after being blacklisted. Attackers can trick users into granting allowances through phishing schemes or malicious transactions. Once blacklisted, they can still drain users' approved tokens, bypassing the blacklist's intended security measures and undermining regulatory compliance efforts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a blacklist check in the transferFrom function to prevent blacklisted addresses from initiating transfers:
```javascript
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {  
    if (blacklisted(msg.sender)) revert Blacklisted(msg.sender);  
    _spendAllowance(from, msg.sender, amount);  
    _transfer(from, to, amount);  
    return true;  
}  
```
