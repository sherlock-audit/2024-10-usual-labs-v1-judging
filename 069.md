# UsualX shares can still be transferred even when paused

### Summary

_No response_
 
### Root Cause

When comparing UsualX shares to other protocol tokens, we can see that all are pausable and also incorporate the blacklisting functionality. In [Usual](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usual.sol#L143C1-L157C6) tokens for instance, we can see that during up when the contract is paused, transfers are will not be possible.

```solidity
    /// @notice Hook that ensures token transfers are not made from or to not blacklisted addresses.
    /// @param from The address sending the tokens.
    /// @param to The address receiving the tokens.
    /// @param amount The amount of tokens being transferred.
    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        internal
        virtual
        override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable, ERC20Upgradeable)
    {
        UsualStorageV0 storage $ = _usualStorageV0();
        if ($.isBlacklisted[from] || $.isBlacklisted[to]) {
            revert Blacklisted();
        }
        super._update(from, to, amount);
    }
```
In UsualX, however, when the contract is [paused](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L139), token transfers are still possible.

```solidity
    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        internal
        override(ERC20Upgradeable)
    {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        if ($.isBlacklisted[from] || $.isBlacklisted[to]) {
            revert Blacklisted();
        }
        super._update(from, to, amount);
    }
```
### Internal pre-conditions
_No response_

### External pre-conditions
_No response_

 
### Attack Path
_No response_


### Impact
 
Tokens can still be transferred when paused, which allows users to still be able to deposit and receive shares and transfer them between themselves even when contract is paused.

### PoC
_No response_
 
### Mitigation

Check that contract is not paused in the `_update` function.
