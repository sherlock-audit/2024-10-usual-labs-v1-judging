# Potential Front-Running Vulnerability Allowing Redemptions Before Blacklisting Takes Effect

### Summary

The `blacklist(address account)`function in the Usd0 contract :: `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0.sol#L176` can be front-run, allowing a targeted account to perform actions before being effectively blacklisted. When the blacklist function is called, a malicious actor could anticipate this transaction and execute functions, such as _update for transferring or redeeming tokens, before the blacklisting status is applied. This bypass allows the actor to transfer or redeem tokens from or to blacklisted addresses, undermining the security measure intended to restrict these accounts.

### Root Cause

In Usd0.sol:176 blacklist function, the lack of a mechanism to enforce immediate blacklisting upon call execution allows for potential front-running. This oversight enables the targeted account to complete actions such as token transfers or redemptions in the _update function before the blacklisting restriction is effectively applied.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `BLACKLIST_ROLE` calls `blacklist(address account)` on `Usd0` contract with argument `account` as attacker's account address.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

	1.The transaction is pending in the mempool, where an attacker monitors for any calls to blacklist their account.
	2.Upon detecting the pending blacklist call, the attacker immediately initiates a transfer or redemption transaction using the _update function.
	3.The attackerâ€™s transaction is processed before the blacklist function call, allowing the attacker to transfer or redeem tokens successfully before the blacklisting restriction is applied.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss in security enforcement, allowing blacklisted accounts to complete unauthorized transfers or redemptions. The attacker gains the ability to move or redeem assets before blacklist restrictions are applied, circumventing compliance and security policies, resulting in potential reputational and operational risk for the protocol.
