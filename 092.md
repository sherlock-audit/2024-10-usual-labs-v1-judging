# usd0PP::allocateEarlyUnlockBalance is vulnerable to frontrinning and sandwiching

### Summary

This is a issue similar to frontrunning to ERC20 approval race, a user can use up their "allowance" before a new one is set allowing themselves access to more tokens than intended 

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

a user would be able to unlock more than intended by the protocol 

### PoC

assume bob was an early withdraw amount of 1000 tokens but the protocol wants to allow bob withdraw 2000 tokens and make a call to setting balancesToAllocate[bob] to 2000 
bob could frontrun the call and use his current 1000 allowance, then backrun it for the 2000 more allowing bob to withdraw a total of 3000 tokens 

### Mitigation

the function could be modified so that is either adds or removes a certain amount from a users balances 
eg 
enum operation {
Add;
Subtraact;}

    function allocateEarlyUnlockBalance(
        address[] calldata addressesToAllocateTo,
        uint256[] calldata balancesToAllocate,
operation[] memory operate
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
checks 
      for (uint256 i; i < addressesToAllocateTo.length;) {
if (operate[i] == operation.Add {
 $.bondEarlyUnlockAllowedAmount[addressesToAllocateTo[i]] += balancesToAllocate[i];
} else {
 $.bondEarlyUnlockAllowedAmount[addressesToAllocateTo[i]] -= balancesToAllocate[i];
}
           
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
}

using this method for the previous example then instead of passing 2000 as the new amount, the caller could call 1000 with add
