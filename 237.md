# Restricting CHALLENGER from challenging the merkleroot when the contract is paused causes loss of funds for the users.

### Summary

`DISTRIBUTION_OPERATOR_ROLE` has the privilege to push `{merkleroot , block.timestamp}` into the `offChainDistributionQueue` which can be challenged by the `DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGER_ROLE` to remove it if he finds it to be the `corrupted` merkleroot later but within the timeframe of `1 week`.

But the problem is that `DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGER_ROLE` cannot call `challengeOffChainDistribution()` when the contract is `paused` which results in `corrupted merkleRoot` that got queued to become executable at the time when  the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` decides to `unpause` the contract.

It is also to be note that `approveUnchallengedOffChainDistribution()`[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L427) can be called by anyone to approve the `latest merkleroot` , that makes an attackor to easily execute this operation just after the contract is `unpaused` and quickly  calls `claimOffChainDistribution()` to avail his incorrect amount of `USUAL` shares which causes loss of funds to other users.  

### Root Cause

`whenNotPaused` check in `challengeOffChainDistribution()` that `restricts` `DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGER_ROLE` to remove `corrupted merkleroots` from the `offChainDistributionQueue`.

### Internal pre-conditions

merkleroot pushed by `DISTRIBUTION_OPERATOR_ROLE`  found to be corrupted by the `DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGER_ROLE`. 
Contract is `paused` just after the corrupted merkle root is pushed and is `paused` for atleast `1 week`. 

### External pre-conditions

Corrupted merkleroot provides an undesired amount of shares to the attacker causing losses to other legit users.

### Attack Path

1. `DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGER_ROLE` pushes a merkleroot into the `offChainDistributionQueue` by calling `queueOffChainUsualDistribution()`.

2. `PAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE` `paused` the contract due to any valid reason.

3. `DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGER_ROLE` identified that the last merkleroot pushed by  `DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGER_ROLE` is corrupted but he is unable to call `challengeOffChainDistribution()` due to the `whenNotPaused` check.

4. So when contract is back again after one week, the attacker can easily front run all other transaction to execute `approveUnchallengedOffChainDistribution()` and claim the incorrect amount of `USUAL` tokens from the `usualDistribution` causing losses to other users.

### Impact

`DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGER_ROLE` cannot challenge the queued corrupted merkleroot when the contract is `paused` which causes the attacker to claim an undesirable amount  by utilising other legit users `USUAL` shares when the contract is back.

### PoC
NA

### Mitigation

remove whenNotPaused check from challengeOffChainDistribution()
