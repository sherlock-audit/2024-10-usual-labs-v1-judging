# UsualX.withdraw subtracts from totalDeposits incorrect fee amount

### Summary

`UsualX.withdraw` accepts `assets` param as the final amount to withdraw, post any fees. It calculates the `fee` amount in order to subtract it from `totalDeposits`. However it uses the `assets` (which is already post fees) to calculate the `fee`, which is incorrect.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L336

```solidity
// Calculate shares needed
shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
@> uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

// Perform withdrawal (exact assets to receiver)
super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);

// take the fee
yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
```

eg if fee is 20%. deposit is 100. and withdraw is 80, the fee should be 20, however we get 80*0.2 = 16.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Incorrect accounting.
- `totalDeposits` is used as part of `startYieldDistribution`, which will require for the asset balance to be higher than it actually needs to be.

```solidity
if (_asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < $.totalDeposits + yieldAmount) {
    revert InsufficientAssetsForYield();
}
```

### PoC

```solidity
// UsualXUnit.t.sol
function test_withdraw_bad_fee() public{
    uint256 fee = 20_00;
    vm.prank(admin);
    registryAccess.grantRole(WITHDRAW_FEE_UPDATER_ROLE, address(this));
    usualX.updateWithdrawFee(fee);

    uint256 depositAmount = 100e18;

    vm.startPrank(alice);
    ERC20Mock(usual).mint(alice, depositAmount);
    ERC20Mock(usual).approve(address(usualX), depositAmount);
    usualX.deposit(depositAmount, alice);

    uint256 snap = vm.snapshot();

    // ---

    usualX.redeem(usualX.maxRedeem(alice), alice, alice);

    console.log(usualX.totalAssets()); // 0

    // ---

    vm.revertTo(snap);

    usualX.withdraw(usualX.maxWithdraw(alice), alice, alice);

    console.log(usualX.totalAssets()); // 20e18-16e18 = 4000000000000000000
}
```

### Mitigation

Calculate fee correctly.
