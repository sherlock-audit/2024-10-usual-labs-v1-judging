# Loss of Untracked Stable Fees

### Summary

The function `burnStableTokenAndTransferCollateral` in `DaoCollateral.sol` subtracts a stableFee from the stableAmount but does not store this fee, causing it to be untracked. This oversight could lead to the permanent loss of collected fees that could otherwise be used for reward distribution, treasury funds, or platform maintenance.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Untracked Fees: The untracked stableFee results in lost funds that could benefit the treasury or be distributed as rewards.

### PoC

The current function does not store stableFee after subtracting it, resulting in untraceable funds.
```javascript
function _burnStableTokenAndTransferCollateral(
    address rwaToken,
    uint256 stableAmount,
    uint256 stableFee
) internal returns (uint256 returnedCollateral) {
    DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
   @>  uint256 burnedStable = stableAmount - stableFee;
    $.usd0.burnFrom(msg.sender, stableAmount);

    // No storage or tracking of the `stableFee`
    returnedCollateral = _getTokenAmountForAmountInUSD(burnedStable, rwaToken);
    if (returnedCollateral == 0) {
        revert AmountTooLow();
    }

    IERC20Metadata(rwaToken).safeTransferFrom($.treasury, msg.sender, returnedCollateral);
}
```

### Mitigation

Store stableFee in a designated treasury balance, fee tracker, or rewards pool to ensure it is accurately accounted for and accessible for distribution.
