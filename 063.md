# Blacklisted users will keep earning yield on UsualX

### Summary

Blacklisted users will keep earning yield with their UsualX shares causing yields to be continuously lower than they should be.

### Root Cause

When a user is blacklisted, they are blocked from transferring UsualX vault shares. But, they are allowed to keep their shares, see [UsualX.sol:156](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L156) & [UsualX.sol:201](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L201).

That means any yield distributed to actual users will be diluted. The blacklisted user's shares will still earn yield.

Instead, the user's shares should be converted to assets and transferred to them when they are removed from the blacklist. That way, regular users will earn the full yield.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Loss of yield for regular users. The size depends on the number of shares blacklisted users hold.

### PoC

### Mitigation

user's shares should be converted to assets and transferred to them when they are removed from the blacklist. So the user is given any yield they've earned up to the point they were added to the blacklist. 

The user's shares should be burned and the asset amount should be removed from `totalDeposits` so that the exchange ratio between asset and vault shares is correct.
