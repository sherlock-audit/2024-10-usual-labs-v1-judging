# `yieldStorage.totalDeposits` will wrongly track the total deposits

### Summary

`yieldStorage.totalDeposits` gets updated when there's a deposit or withdrawal, and it adds the assets after accounting the fee and subtracts the assets after we redeem our shares (withdraw).

In the `struct YieldStorage`, it is explicitly stated in the comment above the `uint256 totalDeposits` that it excludes any fees.
Comment - ` /// tracked separately from assets reserved for yield. **It excludes fees**`

But in `withdraw()` and `redeem()`, we can see that we subtract the `yieldStorage.totalDeposits` with the `fee` and this is very dangerous, because it will make the `totalDeposits` have a smaller number that it actually have - etc. underflow it.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the subtraction of the `yieldStorage.totalDeposits` with the `fee` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L342) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L377) as well.

This will underflow the actual `totalDeposits` with each call to `withdraw()` and `redeem()`, thus producing a smaller `totalDeposits` value and eventually underflow it, which will happen with non-malicious activity inevitably.

### Internal pre-conditions

Users need to call `withdraw()` and `redeem()` enough times and it will underflow, which will happen inevitably happen

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `yieldStorage.totalDeposits` will have a smaller value and it will decrement with each call to `withdraw()` and `redeem()`, thus underflowing and making users unable to claim their deposits.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the subtraction
