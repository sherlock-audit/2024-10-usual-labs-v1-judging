# Potential Issue with Collateral Burned Before Reverting in redeem Function

### Summary

In the  `DaoCollateral.sol::redeem` contract, a malicious user could trigger a scenario where they specify a small amount, leading to the function reverting with an "AmountTooLow" error. The issue is that the collateral has already been burned before this check, making it impossible to revert the collateral back. Additionally, because no event is emitted prior to the revert, the user might feel that the transaction failed without receiving feedback about the burned collateral.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User Confusion: The user will not be able to determine whether the redeem operation succeeded or failed correctly, leading to confusion about the status of their collateral and the lack of transparency.

### PoC

1. A user calls the redeem function with a very high minAmountOut value.
2. The function burns the collateral before verifying if the minAmountOut condition is met.
3. The returned collateral is less than the specified minAmountOut.
4. The function reverts with the "AmountTooLow" error, but the collateral has already been burned.
5. Since the collateral burning happens before the revert, the burn is not reversible, and no event is emitted, causing the user to be unaware that the collateral was burned.

### Mitigation

Refactor the code to perform the minAmountOut check before burning any collateral. This ensures that if the condition fails, no collateral will be burned and the function can revert safely.
