# Top20% user won't be able to claim there usual rewards which are allocated to them airdrop distribution.

### Summary

The `AirdropDistribution` contract allows 4 different types of claiming of usual rewards.
1. top20 percent can claim rewards after 12 Dec, without vesting
2. pat the tax and get the whole amount top80 
3. claim the rewards on monthly basis as each month pass till jun12
4. Rage-quit and won't be able to claim any rewards

The issue here is the user who is present in Top20 percent and allowed to claim reward after 12 dec, can't claim rewards if they have minted USDOPP and vested USDO for 4 years.

As mentioned by the protocol docs if these certain condition if they occur user can't call some methods of claiming.
docs -> https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLNEXyS0=/
1. If user pay complete tax they can't escape/the vesting or rage-quit and need to wait for whole 4 years(option 2 disable option 4 refer above  link)
2. if user call rage-quit they can't pat tax and also can't claim on monthly basis(option 4 disable option 3,2 )

Lets address the issue :-
1. The TOP20 percent USERS can claim there rewards anytime after the `AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME = 1_734_004_800; // Dec 12 2024 12:00:00 GMT+0000`
2. The USER who have deposited in USDOPP for 4 year can quit before the max time of `END_OF_EARLY_UNLOCK_PERIOD = 1_735_686_000; // 31st Dec 2024 23:00:00 GMT+0000`
3. the user who deposited in USDOPP and in top20 percent also if they quit before 31 DEC. that user can't claim there rewards
4. `the protocol wanted to disable only certain option which are mentioned above, and there is no restrictions mentioned or implies for top20 user. but these case will stop them from claiming rewards.`

```solidity 
  function claim(address account, bool isTop80, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
    {
        if (account == address(0)) {
            revert NullAddress();
        }
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert AmountIsZero();
        }

        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $ = _airdropDistributionStorageV0();

        if (!_verifyMerkleProof($, account, isTop80, amount, proof)) {
            revert InvalidProof();
        }

        if ($.ragequit[account]) {
            revert AirdropVoided();
        }

        (uint256 amountToClaim, uint256 penaltyAmount) = _available($, account, amount, isTop80);

        $.claimed[account] += amountToClaim + penaltyAmount;
        $.usualToken.mint(account, amountToClaim);
        emit Claimed(account, amountToClaim);
    }


   function _available(
        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $,
        address account,
        uint256 totalAmount,
        bool isTop80
    ) internal returns (uint256, uint256) {
        if (block.timestamp < AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME) {
            revert NotClaimableYet();
        }
     -----
}
```

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is not handling the case where if top20 percent user calls `temporaryOneToOneExitUnwrap` to withdraw USDO, rage_quit == true means can't claim there rewards from airdropDistribution.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L332

### Internal pre-conditions

Account calling `temporaryOneToOneExitUnwrap` before calling `AirdropDistribution:claim()`,rage-quit == true

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The Top20 account will never be able to claim USUAL rewards.

### PoC

1. Account deposited in `USDOPP` contract after bond_period and before 4_YEAR time-period finished.
2. Account is allotted in Airdrop_vesting to claim funds without a need to vesting.
3. Account owner wants to withdraw funds/quit before  END_OF_EARLY_UNLOCK_PERIOD = 1_735_686_000; // 31st Dec 2024 23:00:00 GMT+0000
4. they call `temporaryOneToOneExitUnwrap` and take out there USDO tokens
5. Account try to call claim in `airdropDistribution` contract and revert due to rageQuit == true. 

### Mitigation

revise the code if the user is in top80 percent and did rage-quit then should not be able to claim rewards.
` if ($.ragequit[account]) && isTop80) {
            revert AirdropVoided();
   }`
