# The USD_BURNER caanot burn tokens from blacklisted accounts due to the check in _update

## Summary
The ``USD_BURN`` role cannot burn tokens if the target account has been blacklisted.
The ``USD_BURN`` should have the capability to burn tokens of any account, even if the account is blacklisted.
However, there is a check that prevents that.

## Root Cause
In the ``Usd0`` contract, both the ``burn`` and the ``burnFrom`` functions call the ``_burn`` which calls ``_update``
```javascript
 function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        internal
        virtual
        override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable, ERC20Upgradeable)
    {
        Usd0StorageV0 storage $ = _usd0StorageV0();
        if ($.isBlacklisted[from] || $.isBlacklisted[to]) {
            revert Blacklisted();
        }
        super._update(from, to, amount);
    }
```
``_update`` overrides the base the base implementation and includes two checks,
```javascript
 if ($.isBlacklisted[from] || $.isBlacklisted[to]) {
            revert Blacklisted();
```
This makes burning from a blacklisted account not possible.

## Impact
The ``USD_ROLE`` cannot burn tokens if the target account has been blacklisted.
## Mitigation
Allow the ``BURNER`` to burn tokens without checking if the address has been blacklisted,
