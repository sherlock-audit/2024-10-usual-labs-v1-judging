# Lack of Update of Owner Shares in `withdraw`

### Summary

The withdraw function in UsualX.sol does not properly update the owner's balance after a withdrawal. Specifically, the owner's shares are not deducted from their balance when they withdraw assets. This oversight may cause the owner's share balance to be inconsistent with their actual assets, leading to errors in future calculations or possible exploitation. To ensure proper balance management and prevent such inconsistencies, the owner's share balance should be updated when assets are withdrawn.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Inconsistent Share Balance: If the owner's shares are not deducted after a withdrawal, the system may believe the owner still holds those shares, leading to inaccurate calculations in subsequent operations

### PoC

Here is the vulnerable code for reference:
```javascript
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
    public
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 shares)
{
    UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
    YieldDataStorage storage yieldStorage = _getYieldDataStorage();

    // Check withdrawal limit
    uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
    if (assets > maxAssets) {
        revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
    }
    // Calculate shares needed
    shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
    uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

    // Perform withdrawal (exact assets to receiver)
    super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);

    // Take the fee
    yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
}
```
In this code, while the withdrawal operation is performed, the owner's share balance is not updated to reflect the withdrawal. This means that, after the assets are withdrawn, the owner's share balance still includes the withdrawn amount, which is an issue.

### Mitigation

Reactor the code to:

```javascript
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
    public
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 shares)
{
    UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
    YieldDataStorage storage yieldStorage = _getYieldDataStorage();

    // Check withdrawal limit
    uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
    if (assets > maxAssets) {
        revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
    }
    
    // Calculate shares needed to withdraw the requested assets
    shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
    uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

    // Perform the withdrawal of assets (exact amount to receiver)
    super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);

    // Deduct the owner's shares after withdrawal
   +  $._balances[owner] -= shares;  // Update owner's balance by deducting the withdrawn shares

    // Adjust the total deposits after fee
    yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;

    return shares;  // Return the number of shares withdrawn
}
```
