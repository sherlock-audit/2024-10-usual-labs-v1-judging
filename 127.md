### Attack Path

Following is the extract taken from the [USUAL technical documentation](https://usual.gitbook.io/usual-technical-documentation/Aw3jUdIChYIRnEPcqUqK/overview/features/usual-1):

> USUAL* is a specialized token designed for early investors, contributors, and advisors of the Usual protocol, granting them unique benefits and governance power. It inherits basic functionalities from the USUAL token. Holders of USUAL* are entitled to 10% of all USUAL distributions, a right that is permanently integrated into the protocol and cannot be overridden. Initially, USUAL* holders maintain majority voting control to ensure the project adheres to its roadmap during the early stages of development. Over time, the governance structure will evolve toward a more decentralized model centered on USUAL token holders, but without compromising the immutable rights of USUAL* holders.

The USUAL* holder has immutable rights and is entitled to 10% of all USUAL distribution. This must be permanently integrated into the protocol and cannot be overridden. Otherwise, it is considered a core feature being broken within the protocol.

Thus, this property must be upheld within the protocol and cannot be changed under any circumstance so that the immutable rights are upheld. However, that is not true within the protocol.

However, the distribution allocator can remove the immutable rights of USUAL* holders anytime they wish by calling the [`setBucketsDistribution`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L645) function, which in turn executes the [`_setUsualStar`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L878) function, to update the USUAL allocation to USUAL* holders from 10% to 0%, thus breaking the protocol's core feature. 

As a result, it could lead to a loss of USUAL tokens for the USUAL* holders.

```solidity
File: DistributionModule.sol
875:     /// @notice Sets the UsualStar distribution percentage
876:     /// @param $ Storage struct of the contract
877:     /// @param _usualStar UsualStar distribution percentage
878:     function _setUsualStar(DistributionModuleStorageV0 storage $, uint256 _usualStar) internal {
879:         $.usualStarDistributionShare = _usualStar;
880:         emit ParameterUpdated("usualStar", _usualStar);
881:     }
```

### Impact

Core protocol feature could be broken and USUAL* holder's immutable rights could be overwritten, leading to the loss of USUAL tokens to the USUAL* holders.

Severity: Rated as Medium due to the following Sherlock rules:

- Causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states, or a loss is highly constrained
- Breaks core contract functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The USUAL* holder distribution should be hardcoded to 10% to ensure it is immutable and cannot be overwritten by other actors (e.g., distribution allocator)
