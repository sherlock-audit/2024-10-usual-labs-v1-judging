# Users are going to pay double or more tax during the claiming process of airdropped tokens

### Summary

Airdropped funds are to be claimed via `claim()` and penalties are going to be applied if the user is in the top 80%.

If I claim my funds during the first month that they are available, I will pay penalty only for the first month.
Two months pass and I call `claim()` a second time to get the 2nd and 3rd portion of the funds, but I will get penalized for the first month again. 

The logic for looping through the months and their respective account and penalty [will always start from 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L200)

### Root Cause

The root cause is there is **no logic responsible for accounting the months** that we've already paid a penalty, so we will pay penalty two or more times for months we've already claimed our portion. 

The `for loop` always starts iterating [from 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L200) as shown in the link I provided in the summary.

This means that with partial claiming, there will be 100% possibility of a loss, starting from the second call to `claim()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

User claims partially 2 or more times via `claim()` and he must be in the top 80%

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `Alice` calls `claim()` to partially claim the vested funds for the first month they're released
2. `Alice` then waits 2 more months and again calls `claim()`, but she finds that she has been penalized for the first month a second time

### Impact

Users will get less airdrop tokens due to lack of accounting in regards to the months they've already been penalized

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Account the months a user has already paid a penalty
