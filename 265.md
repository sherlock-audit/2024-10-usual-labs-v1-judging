# The internal function _update remain inaccessible within the protocol

### Summary

## Summary
The internal function ``_update`` in ``Usual.sol`` is defined but never called , making it ineffective in the managing of blacklisted accounts. As a result, funds become permanently locked for blacklisted users, preventing any transfers between accounts.
```javascript

    /// @notice Hook that ensures token transfers are not made from or to not blacklisted addresses.
    /// @param from The address sending the tokens.
    /// @param to The address receiving the tokens.
    /// @param amount The amount of tokens being transferred.
    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        internal
        virtual
        override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable, ERC20Upgradeable)
    {
        UsualSStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSStorageV0();
        if ($.isBlacklisted[from] || $.isBlacklisted[to]) {
            revert Blacklisted();
        }
        super._update(from, to, amount);
    }
```

### Root Cause

_update: This function checks for blacklisted accounts on transfers but is also never called, preventing blacklist checks from taking effect on transfers and transfer.

### Internal pre-conditions

Blacklisted accounts exist and are unable to perform transfers or retrieve funds due to the inaccessible functions.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

These function is unused and inaccessible; blacklisted funds cannot be transferred or recovered by the protocol, resulting in permanent loss of access to their balance.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Integrate and _update within the protocolâ€™s workflow to ensure proper handling of blacklisted accounts and transferring funds between accounts.
