### Attack Path

After the emergency withdrawal of USD0 on `Usd0PP` contract, the `Usd0PP` is technically backed by nothing on-chain as all the USD0 backing has been transferred to the `safeAccount` address, as per Lines 408-410 below. At this point in time, the `Usd0PP` token is technically worth nothing (`$0.00`) in a financial sense since it is no longer backed by USD0 within the `Usd0PP` contract.

```solidity
File: Usd0PP.sol
397:     /// @notice function for executing the emergency withdrawal of Usd0.
398:     /// @param  safeAccount The address of the account to withdraw the Usd0 to.
399:     /// @dev    Reverts if the caller does not have the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE role.
400:     function emergencyWithdraw(address safeAccount) external {
401:         Usd0PPStorageV0 storage $ = _usd0ppStorageV0();
402: 
403:         if (!$.registryAccess.hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
404:             revert NotAuthorized();
405:         }
406:         IERC20 usd0 = $.usd0;
407: 
408:         uint256 balance = usd0.balanceOf(address(this));
409:         // get the collateral token for the bond
410:         usd0.safeTransfer(safeAccount, balance);
411: 
412:         // Pause the contract
413:         _pause();
414: 
415:         emit EmergencyWithdraw(safeAccount, balance);
416:     }
```

When this scenario is realized, it makes financial sense for the USD0PP holders AND users entitled to airdrop (these users could purchase USD0PP at a discount from the open market if they do not already own them) to exploit this opportunity to execute `AirdropTaxCollector._payTaxAmount` to pay tax to the protocol. In this case, the worthless (or heavily discounted) USD0PP will be transferred to the protocol's treasury, and they gain the ability to redeem all their USUAL airdrop without waiting for the vesting period.

In addition, it is possible that an emergency withdrawal is executed in response to an ongoing attack against the `Usd0PP` contract, in which the attacker managed to drain the USD0 residing within the `Usd0PP` contract. In this case, the emergency withdrawal will be executed to transfer all existing USD0 to a safe address to prevent further USD0 from being stolen. In such a scenario, the price of USD0PP is likely to drop significantly. Thus, this will incentivize users to off-load their USD0PP, and they will take this opportunity to pay tax in USD0PP to transfer the downside of holding the USD0PP to the protocol while enjoying the perks of being able to unlock all their airdrop USUAL tokens immediately.

```solidity
File: AirdropTaxCollector.sol
245:     /// @notice Pays the tax amount for the given account.
246:     /// @param account The account to pay the tax for.
247:     /// @dev This function can only be called during the claiming period.
248:     function _payTaxAmount(address account) internal {
..SNIP..
272:         $.taxedClaimers[account] = true;
273:         $.usd0PP.setBondEarlyUnlockDisabled(account);
274:         emit AirdropTaxPaid(account, claimTaxAmount);
275: 
276:         $.usd0PP.safeTransferFrom(account, $.treasury, claimTaxAmount);
277:     }
```

### Impact

The protocol will end up holding many USD0PP tokens, which might be worthless or heavily discounted, during an emergency while giving up the ability to vest the airdropped USUAL tokens to their users over a period of time.

Severity: Medium. The issue causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states, or a loss is highly constrained

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When the USD0PP is no longer backed by USD0 on the `USD0PP` contract, the value of the USD0PP tokens will be worthless (or heavily discounted). Given this uncertainty and unfavorable conditions, it would be prudent for the protocol's treasury to stop accepting USD0PP as a tax payment and, at the same time, prevent large outflow of USUAL tokens from the protocol due to users exploiting the issue.

A quick fix would be to pause the `AirdropTaxCollector.payTaxAmount` automatically when the `Usd0PP.emergencyWithdraw` function is executed.
