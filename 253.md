# Incorrect fees deducted from totalDeposits in the withdraw().





### Summary
Fees are deducted incorrectly before transferring assets to the caller while withdraw().



```solidity
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares) {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        // Calculate the fee based on the equivalent assets of these shares
        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
            assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil
        );
        // Calculate total assets needed, including fee
        uint256 assetsWithFee = assets + fee;

        // Convert the total assets (including fee) to shares
        shares = _convertToShares(assetsWithFee, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    }
```
`fees` = (`assets` * `withdrawFeeBps` ) / 1 - `withdrawFeeBps`.(1) 

`assetsWithFee` = `assets` + `fees` =  `assets` +  (`assets` * `withdrawFeeBps` ) / (1 - `withdrawFeeBps` ) (2)

from (1) and (2)

=> `assetsWithFee` = `assets` / 1 - `withdrawFeeBps`

=> `fees` = `assetsWithFee` * `withdrawFeeBps`

Here, `assetsWithFee` is calculated such that the user gets the exact amount of assets they requested after the fee deduction. 
and the shares to be burned are calculated using this assetsWithFee amount.

However, during the actual withdrawal process, the fee calculation logic is incorrect.

Instead of using assetsWithFee for the fee calculation, it mistakenly uses the user-specified assets amount.

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) ...
    {
       ....

        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
    -=> uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);


        // Perform withdrawal (exact assets to receiver)
        super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);


        // take the fee
        yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
    }
```

This leads to under-collecting fees because the calculation should be:

```solidity
    uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assetsWithFee, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
```


### Root Cause

Incorrect calculation of fees when user executes withdraw() function.
Instead of calculating fees from assetsWithFee , code actually calculates from assets.

### Internal pre-conditions
User deposit and then executes withdraw()


### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Since the fee collected is less than intended, the vault's accounting for totalDeposits is incorrect. This affects the overall yield distribution and reward calculations for other users.
The incorrect reduction of totalDeposits can result in skewed reward rates, leading to either inflated or reduced rewards for stakers.
