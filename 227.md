# users can profit of airdrop

### Summary

Staking Participation: Users who stake their USD0 tokens and mint USD0++ bonds are the primary participants in the airdrop event. The more tokens a user stakes, the more USD0++ they receive, making them eligible for a larger portion of the airdrop when users mint the amount is sent to aidropdistribution to distribute the airdrop to the eligible user

however a user can exploit this design to claim airdrop by staking just before a airdrop event is about to start
a user can do the following
a aidrop distribution is about to take place user sees this
he stakes usd0 token in the uds0pp contract
when the airdrop distribution starts user pays a tax amount (if he wants to claim the entire airdrop )
calls the claim function

user successfully  claims the entire airdrop amount and unstakes his usd token this opens a window for a malicious user to gain guaranteed profit the since the users who are stakers from a longer period and someone who just staked is treated same while claiming the airdrop
