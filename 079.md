# Offchain user cannot claim their funds when the assigned amount gets larger than offChainDistributionMintCap

### Summary

The claimOffChainDistribution function lacks flexibility, which prevents users from claiming their funds if their assigned **amount** is larger than the daily limit set by offChainDistributionMintCap. When this happens, the function fails (reverts) due to this cap restriction.

Here’s how it works:
	•	The `offChainDistributionMintCap` is the maximum amount of tokens a user can claim in a single day.
	•	The `amount` is the total amount of tokens assigned to a user’s account over time and will increase as more tokens are allocated.
	•	If a user tries to claim their funds later, their total assigned amount may have grown larger than the daily cap. This causes the function to fail when calculating `amountToSend = amount - claimedUpToNow`, as amountToSend could exceed the daily cap.

In short, users trying to claim a large amount that’s over the daily limit will face issues, especially if they haven’t claimed in a while.

### Root Cause

In `distributionModule.sol:415` the condition if (`amountToSend > $.offChainDistributionMintCap`) will revert the transaction when the amount is large and claimedUpToNow is zero:
`uint256 amountToSend = amount - claimedUpToNow;`

### Internal pre-conditions

	1.	The amount of tokens assigned to a user is large.
	2.	The user delays claiming their funds, causing them to accumulate over time.
	3.	Some users rush (frontrunning) to claim their funds first, while others are unable to claim theirs.

### External pre-conditions

The offChainDistributionMintCap is low, or the daily distribution of Usual tokens results in a small amount being allocated to off-chain users.

### Attack Path

	1.	**Setup:** The user’s account is assigned a total amount over time, which continues to grow as more tokens are allocated. The user does not claim these tokens regularly, so their assigned amount accumulates to a value much higher than the daily offChainDistributionMintCap.
	2.	**Attempt to Claim:** The user tries to call claimOffChainDistribution to withdraw their accumulated funds.
	3.	Calculation of Amount to Send: Inside the function, amountToSend is calculated as amount - claimed.
	4.	Revert Due to Cap Restriction: The function checks if amountToSend > offChainDistributionMintCap. As amountToSend is indeed higher than the cap, the function reverts, and the user’s claim fails.
	5.	Funds Locked: Since the function reverts, the user is unable to claim any of their funds

### Impact

The offchain users cannot claim their funds when their total assigned amount is larger than the daily mint cap, leading to a potential loss of access to allocated funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow users to claim a portion of their total assigned amount when it exceeds the daily offChainDistributionMintCap.

```diff
    // Modify here: if amountToSend is greater than the daily cap, set it to the daily cap
    if (amountToSend > $.offChainDistributionMintCap) {
-       revert NoTokensToClaim();
+       amountToSend = $.offChainDistributionMintCap;
    }
```
