# Airdrop users can avoid paying tax

### Summary
Rounding to zero means Airdrop users can avoid paying tax before early claiming

### Root Cause
Rounding to Zero in tax calculation

### Internal pre-conditions
User has Airdrop tokens to claim

### External pre-conditions
No response

### Attack Path
Users are allowed to claim their Airdrop tokens early if they pay a tax via [payTaxAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.sol#L241-L243). `payTaxAmount()` calculates how much tax needs to be paid in `_calculateClaimTaxAmount()`.

However rounding down to zero can occur when calculating the tax amount in [_calculateClaimTaxAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.sol#L217-L234).

On line 232 if the numerator `$.maxChargeableTax * claimingTimeLeft` is less than the denominator `AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH` the calculated `taxFee` will be `0` because of Rounding down.
If that happens then the subsequent calculation for `claimTaxAmount` will also be `0` allowing user to withdraw their Airdrop early without paying tax.

```solidity
L232:       uint256 taxFee = $.maxChargeableTax.mulDiv(claimingTimeLeft, AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH);
L233:       claimTaxAmount = claimerUsd0PPBalance.mulDiv(taxFee, BASIS_POINT_BASE);
```

The point at which a user can withdraw without incurring a fee depends on the value set for `$.maxChargeableTax`. 
For example, if set to the maximum value, `$.maxChargeableTax == 10_000`, users can withdraw for free ~26 mins early. The lower `$.maxChargeableTax`, the earlier can funds be withdrawn and given that `$.maxChargeableTax` starts at `10_000` when the protocol initializes, it is likely that `$.maxChargeableTax` decreases as the Airdrop Claiming Period progresses.

Example:
Assume maximum tax value `$.maxChargeableTax == 10_000` and the `AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH` is a constant equaling `15_724_800 seconds` (182 days).

If user calls `payTaxAmount()` with `1_572` seconds left in the period, the calculation of the `taxFee` (L232) will be as:

taxFee = 10_000 * 1572 / 15_724_800 = 0

### Impact
Being able to withdraw early breaks the core protocol functionality of the Airdrop.
The protocol loses revenue in the form of the `USD0pp` taxes which should have been paid.

### Mitigation
Add more precision to `$.maxChargeableTax` so that the numerator can never be less than the denominator
