# user in Top80 will receive less amount of tokens  when user hasn't paid tax.

### Summary

The airdrop are based on the holdings of pills and user are divided in two groups : top80 and top20.

> According to the docs , when tax is not paid for Top80
>  Users must follow a vesting schedule, with tokens becoming available in monthly installments from January 12th to June 12th.

Why user should pay tax?
- The tax is for the  Users who want to  bypass the vesting schedule and claim the entire airdrop at once.

In ``AirdropDistribution:_available``, If the user hasn't paid tax then user will get the tokens monthly but the rewards should be the same for
-  all user who has paid tax  and 
- who hasn't .

Here the users should get all the airdrop tokens monthly even when the tax is not paid but the claimableAmount is decreased. 
```solidity 
  if (isTop80 && !hasPaidTax) { 
      // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
      if (monthsPassed == 0) {
        revert NotClaimableYet();
      }
      claimableAmount = totalAmount.mulDiv(
        monthsPassed,
        AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS // 6 
      );
```
### Root Cause

In  ``AirdropDistribution:L238`` , decreases the claimable reward of users when tax not paid.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. User should be at group top80 and hasn't paid the tax.
### Attack Path

1. User calls ``AirdropDistribution:claim`` to claim their monthly rewards.
2. User should receive ``X `` tokens but instead receive ``Y < X `` tokens. 
### Impact

loss of rewards for user who hasn't paid tax .

### PoC

```solidity    
    if (isTop80 && !hasPaidTax) {
            // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
            if (monthsPassed == 0) {
                revert NotClaimableYet();
            }

>           claimableAmount = totalAmount.mulDiv(monthsPassed, AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS);
        } 
```
Users monthly installment of second month is 2000 tokens.
```solidity
totalAmount  = 2000
monthsPassed = 2
AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS = 6 
claimableAmount = (2000 * 2) / 6 =  666.666666667 = 666.
here the amount claimable is 666 tokens.

```
### Mitigation 
make sure rewards to be fair for users who hasn't paid the tax to receive the same rewards for user who has paid tax
