# Infinite offchain distribution claim bug

### Summary

As said here in [Readme](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1-btorque0x/tree/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution#daily-emissions) 
> DISTRIBUTION_OPERATOR_ROLE is required to call the distributeUsualToBuckets every 24 hours to calculate the new emissions and distribute them to the on-chain buckets and increase the off-chain buckets mint cap that can be claimed after successful approval of the off-chain distribution that is unchallenged and in the queue for more than USUAL_DISTRIBUTION_CHALLENGE_PERIOD.

The likelihood of a user being eligible for multiple distributions is high, given that distributions occur at 24-hour intervals. If this happens, a malicious user could potentially drain all funds allocated to the offchain distribution. 

### Root Cause

In DistributionModule.sol#L386, when user claims offchain distribution, its updates the `claimedByOffChainClaimer[user]` to track internally claimed amount. Each time user claims, the  `claimedByOffChainClaimer[user]` is deducted from the claim amount, to avoid double claims. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L407-L420

There is a high likelihood that the user could be eligible for multiple distributions, where each distribution with different merkleRoot has different claimable amount for the user. The attack goes like; 

1. Operator calls distributeUsualToBuckets() at t=0, then queues it until the challenge period(i.e. 7 days) ends. Distribution goes unchallenged, and approved on day 7th.  
2. Bob as claimant claims 50 unit of usual tokens via `claimOffChainDistribution()`, and `claimedByOffChainClaimer[bob]` changes to 50
3. Operator launch another distribution, which get approved also. And this time, the bob eligible for higher amount, say 150
4. Bobs claims 150 unit, but got `150 - claimedByOffChainClaimer[bob]`(i.e. 100 unit) in his account and `claimedByOffchainClaimer[bob]` is set back 100. 
*Note that the 2nd distribution still allow Bob to go for another 50 unit claim since proof was generated for 150 unit  tokens amount.* 
5. On 3rd claim, the `claimedByOffChainClaimer[bob]` is set back to 50, instead of 150, causing `claimedByOffChainClaimer[bob]` to be transitioning b/w 50 and 100 always, alternatively, allowing bob to claim either 100 unit or 50 unit every single time. This will drained the DistributionModule funds allocated to offchain distribution. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Its required claimers to be eligible in more than one distribution with different claimable amount. 

### Attack Path

See RC. 

### Impact

Infinite minting of usual tokens upto `offChainDistributionMintCap` 

### Mitigation

Modify to below,
```diff
    function claimOffChainDistribution(address account, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
    {
        ...snip...
-       $.claimedByOffChainClaimer[account] = amount;
+       $.claimedByOffChainClaimer[account] += amount;

        emit OffChainDistributionClaimed(account, amountToSend);
        $.usual.mint(account, amountToSend);
    }
```
