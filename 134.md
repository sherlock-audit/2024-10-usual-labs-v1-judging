https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L254

```solidity
File: UsualX.sol
222:     /// @notice Starts a new yield distribution period
223:     /// @dev Can only be called by the distribution contract
224:     /// @param yieldAmount The amount of yield to distribute
225:     /// @param startTime The start time of the new yield period
226:     /// @param endTime The end time of the new yield period
227:     function _startYieldDistribution(uint256 yieldAmount, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime)
..SNIP..
248:         _updateYield();
249: 
250:         uint256 periodDuration = endTime - startTime;
251:         uint256 newYieldRate =
252:             Math.mulDiv(yieldAmount, YIELD_PRECISION, periodDuration, Math.Rounding.Floor);
253: 
254:         if (_asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < $.totalDeposits + yieldAmount) {
255:             revert InsufficientAssetsForYield();
256:         }
```

The check at Line 254 above is incorrect because the USUAL balance of `UsualX` contract (`Usual.balanceOf(address(UsualX)`) is actually made up of three (3) components ( `$.totalDeposits + yieldAmount + withdrawalFeeCollected`) instead of only two components ( `$.totalDeposits + yieldAmount`).

Therefore, if the caller executes the `startYieldDistribution` function without sending USUAL tokens to the `UsualX` contract, it might still pass the check because there is sufficient USUAL residing on the contract due to the withdrawal fee collected earlier.

Assume that  `$.totalDeposits` is 100,000 USUAL, and `withdrawalFeeCollected` is 50,000 USUAL. The USUAL balance of `UsualX` contract (`Usual.balanceOf(address(UsualX)`) will be equal to 150,000 USUAL.

Assume a caller executes the `startYieldDistribution` function with a `yieldAmount` set to 50,000, but does not directly transfer any USUAL to `UsualX` contract before executing the `startYieldDistribution` function, the following check will still not revert.

```solidity
if (_asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < $.totalDeposits + yieldAmount) { revert InsufficientAssetsForYield(); }
if (150000 < 100000 + 50000) { revert InsufficientAssetsForYield(); }
if (false) { revert InsufficientAssetsForYield(); }
```

As a result, the 50,000 USUAL collected withdrawal fee, which belongs to the protocol, will be distributed to USUALX shareholders.

### Impact

The collected withdrawal fee, which belongs to the protocol, will be distributed to USUALX shareholders, leading to a loss of funds for the protocol.

Severity: Medium. The issue causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states, or a loss is highly constrained.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Create a variable (e.g., `withdrawalFeeCollected`) to keep track of the total number of USUAL collected as withdrawal fee.

Then, apply the following changes:

```diff
function _startYieldDistribution(uint256 yieldAmount, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime)
..SNIP..
-    if (_asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < $.totalDeposits + yieldAmount) {
+    if (_asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < $.totalDeposits + yieldAmount + withdrawalFeeCollected) {
        revert InsufficientAssetsForYield();
    }
```

Let's verify using back the same scenario if the validation work as intended if the caller does not transfer any USUAL token beforehand:

```solidity
if (_asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < $.totalDeposits + yieldAmount + withdrawalFeeCollected) { revert InsufficientAssetsForYield(); }
if (150000 < 100000 + 50000 + 50000) { revert InsufficientAssetsForYield(); }
if (150000 < 20000) { revert InsufficientAssetsForYield(); }
if (True) { revert InsufficientAssetsForYield(); } // Revert!
```

The above shows that the mitigation work as intended as it will revert if the caller does not transfer any USUAL token beforehand.
