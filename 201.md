# Vulnerability to Frontrunning in updateWithdrawFee Allows Exploitation of Withdraw Fee

### Summary

The [updateWithdrawFee function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L268) in the UsualX contract is susceptible to frontrunning, enabling attackers to exploit fee changes before they are fully applied across the contract. Authorized roles can update the withdrawal fee, but since there is no delay or mechanism to prevent simultaneous transactions from exploiting the fee change, a malicious user could initiate a withdrawal to avoid a higher fee or benefit from a lower fee in anticipation of the update. This vulnerability could lead to financial losses for the protocol as attackers strategically time their transactions to evade fees or gain favorable terms, while regular users may face unfair disadvantages. Introducing a delay on fee updates or implementing a system to enforce consistent fees across transactions could mitigate this risk.

### Root Cause

In UsualX.sol:updateWithdrawFee, the choice to update the withdrawal fee without an anti-frontrunning mechanism is a mistake, as it allows attackers to anticipate fee changes and perform transactions before the new fee is enforced.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `WITHDRAW_FEE_UPDATER_ROLE` calls `updateWithdrawFee(uint256 newWithdrawFeeBps)` on `UsualX` contract with `newWithdrawFeeBps` greater than the already existing withdrawFee on the contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

	1.	Attacker observes the pending fee update transaction in the mempool and identifies the new fee rate.
	2.	Attacker frontruns the fee change by initiating a withdrawal transaction with the current, lower fee before the update is processed.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a potential loss in anticipated withdrawal fees due to frontrunning, leading to reduced revenue from withdrawals. [The attacker avoids the increased fee, gaining the difference between the old and new fee amounts.]
