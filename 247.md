# Users can front-run `removeAllocation()` to claim their tokens

### Summary

`UsualSP::removeAllocation()` is used to remove the allocation of tokens that are originally allocated via `allocate()`.

In its current implementation, when `UsualSP::removeAllocation()` is called, it will make the users with their removed allocation unable to claim any rewards, because if they try to call `UsualSP::claimReward()`, they won't be able to retrieve any tokens due to the `_updateReward()` execution that will check the lack of any tokens related to the user.

But if a user suspects that his original allocation may be removed, he can monitor the mempool with a bot when the `UsualSP::removeAllocation()` is called and front-run it with a call to `claimReward()`, thus collecting the rewards.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that a user shouldn't be able to call `claimReward()` while having funds in `mapping originalAllocation`. 

If he wants to call `claimReward()`, he should have taken all of the original allocation funds via `claimOriginalAllocation()`, this will remove the possibility of the front-run attack, which can happen very easily, especially if the user is suspecting to have his original allocation removed, but wants to withdraw the accumulated rewards.

This can very well **happen after the `ONE_MONTH` vesting period** and we can see an evidence for this [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L377) - we are resetting the `originalClaimed[account] = 0`, this shows the possibility that after the `ONE_MONTH` vesting period, the `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` may decide to remove someone's funds from the `mapping originalAllocation`

I am referring the `ONE_MONTH` due to its usage as a vesting value in `claimReward()` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L315-L317)

### Internal pre-conditions

User monitors the mempool and sees the call to `removeAllocation()` with his address in the `recipients[]` in order to front-run it.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Operator allocates allocations via `allocate()` passing numerous addresses and their respective funds
2. 5 weeks have passed, the operator decides to remove one of the addresses via `removeAllocation()`
3. The user has suspected  that very possibility in which his funds may be removed via `removeAllocation()` and front-runs it with a call to `claimReward()`, claiming his rewards just before the removal of his funds in `mapping originalAllocation`

### Impact

A user undeserving of rewards will be able to claim them

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I would suggest the following - claim the rewards that have accrued from the original allocation only when the user has claimed the entire original allocation itself OR just don't automatically put the original allocation to be staked: 

(etc. - remove `_updateReward()` from `allocate()`)
