# withdrwals/reedem fees will be stuck in the UsualX contract.

### Summary

when the function withdraw/redeem is called, withdrawal fee is taken from msg.sender/user.the withdrawal fee is also subtracted from  yieldStorage.totalDeposits. As a result, withdrawal fees will be outside of  yieldStorage.totalDeposits/totalsupply mechanism and withdrawal fees will be stuck in the UsualX contract because  there is no way/mechanism to withdraw the withdrawal fees from the UsualX contract.


### Root Cause

withdrawal fees will be outside of  yieldStorage.totalDeposits/totalsupply mechanism and withdrawal fees will be stuck in the UsualX contract because  there is no way/mechanism to withdraw the withdrawal fees from the UsualX contract.

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume,5 users deposit 500 tokens (each user deposits 100 tokens) and 5 users get 500 shares(each user gets 100 shares). So currently totalassets( yieldStorage.totalDeposits) = 500 and totalshares = 500. Currently withdrawal fee = 5%(500 in basis point).
 
2. Let’s assume, currently there is no yield distribution . yield distribution is not accounted for this example(for simplification). 
 
3. Now 1 user calls the function redeem to redeem 100 shares , see the function redeem, the user’s maxShares = maxRedeem(owner) = 100,now the user’s assets(asset after subtracting withdrawal fees) = previewRedeem(shares) = 95(5% is withdrawal fees), the user’s  assetsWithoutFee = 100, the user’s fee = assetsWithoutFee - assets = 100-95 = 5.
 
4. So 100 shares are burned from the user and the user gets 100-5 = 95 assets back(as 5 tokens are withdrawal fees).   Afterthat the fees(i.e 5 tokens) are subtracted from totaldeposits i.e yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee; now currently total shares = 500-100 = 400(as 100 shares is burned) and totalassets( yieldStorage.totalDeposits) = 500-95-5 = 400(as 95 gets user and 5 token withdrawal fee is subtracted from   yieldStorage.totalDeposits). 
 
5. But there will be 5 tokens fees which are not accounted for or added with totalassets or  yieldStorage.totalDeposits which will be stuck in the UsualX contract as there is no way/mechanism to withdraw the withdrawal fees from the UsualX contract.

### Impact

withdrwals/reedem fees will be stuck in the UsualX contract because there is no way/mechanism to withdraw the withdrawal fees from the UsualX contract.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

create a mechanism  to withdraw the withdrawal fees from the UsualX contract.
