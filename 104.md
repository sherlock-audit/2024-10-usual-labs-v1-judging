# Attackers can frontrun and backrun rwa token’s price oracle update against usd and steal rwa tokens from the protocol.

### Summary

rwa token oracle price against usd can decrease(by oracle price update), attacker can monitor the transaction in mempool and frontrun the oracle price update by depositing rwa tokens , then backrun the oracle price update by withdrawing usd0 tokens and he will get more rwa tokens . This is the way an attacker can steal rwa tokens and now there are less rwa tokens in the contract.also normally there will be less rwa tokens to redeem for users if  rwa token oracle price against usd decreases .


### Root Cause

rwa token oracle price against usd can  decrease ,so  Attackers can frontrun , backrun and steal rwa tokens from the protocol.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

rwa token oracle price against usd should decrease.


### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, currently 1 rwa token oracle price is 1 usd and 5 users deposits 500 rwa tokens(each deposits 100 rwa tokens),5 users gets 500 usd0 tokens(each user gets 100 usd0 tokens as 1 rwa token oracle price is 1 usd).so currently total rwa tokens in the treasury contract is 500 and totalsupply of usd0 is 500.
 
2. Now 1 rwa token oracle price will be updated to 0.9 usd, alice observes the oracle price update in the mempool and she frontruns the oracle price update and deposits 100 rwa tokens , gets 100 usd0 tokens (as before oracle price update 1 rwa token price is 1 usd). So now   total rwa tokens in the treasury contract is 600 and totalsupply of usd0 is 600.
 
3. Afterthat, 1 rwa token oracle price is updated to 0.9 usd.
 
4. After the oracle price update , Alice redeems her 100 usd0 tokens and gets 111 rwa tokens(as now 1 usd is 1.11 rwa token). Other 4 users(except 1) also redeem 400 usd0 tokens(each 100 usd0 tokens) and they get 444 rwa tokens(each get 111 rwa token). So currently total rwa tokens in the treasury contract is 600-500 = 100  and totalsupply of usd0 is 600-555 = 45.
 
5. Now there are less rwa tokens in the treasury contract for the last user as the last user has 100 usd0 tokens but there are only 45 rwa tokens in the treasury contract.
. 
6. After the oracle price update, even only Alice redeems her 100 usd0 tokens and gets 111 rwa tokens(as now 1 usd is 1.11 rwa token) and other 4 users(may be they have no knowledge of price oracle update but alice have the knowledge) don't redeem their tokens and after some times  1 rwa token oracle price is updated to 1 usd, so there will be still less rwa tokens to redeem for the 5 users as now totalsupply of usd0 is 500 but total rwa tokens in the treasury contract is 489 tokens(as 500 usd0 value is 500 rwa token). 
. 
7. This is the way alice/attacker can frontrun and backrun rwa token’s price oracle update against usd and steal rwa tokens from the protocol and now there are less rwa tokens for users to redeem .

### Impact

if an attacker fronruns and backruns a large amounts of rwa tokens , he will steal a large amount of rwa tokens.
