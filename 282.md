# The Yield Generation  will start accrual before `periodStart`.

### Summary

The `updateYield` function has a faulty check that causes Yield to begin accruing immediately, even if `periodStart` is set to a future date. As a result, if `startYieldDistribution` is called with a future `periodStart`, it has no effect, and Yield begin accumulating right away. This is problematic because the code intends for `periodStart` to allow setting a start time in the future, as long as itâ€™s not in the past.


### Root Cause

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/YieldBearingVault.sol#L140](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/YieldBearingVault.sol#L140)

### Internal pre-conditions

Following action will result in this vulnerability.
- `CONTRACT_DISTRIBUTION_MODULE` needs to  call `startYieldDistribution` and the  `periodStart`  in future
- Whenever any user call `deposit` function the reward accumulation will start despite the fact that the reward `periodStart` is still in future.
- the only check `$.isActive` is true.


### External pre-conditions

The user only need to deposit into vault before the yield `periodStart` time.


### Attack Path

1. The `CONTRACT_DISTRIBUTION_MODULE` role calls the `startYieldDistribution` and set the `periodStart` after 1 day.
2. The user calls `deposit` function and the yield will start accumulation for it.


### Impact

The only impact it has is that the yield accumulation will not respect the `periodStart` time and start accumulation as the  `CONTRACT_DISTRIBUTION_MODULE` role set the reward distribution.
