# wrong balance while calculating st

### Summary

The St value is a supply factor that inversely adjusts the minting rate based on the supply of USD0++ (or the underlying collateral asset). This means that as the supply of USD0++ increases, the minting rate for USUAL tokens will decrease, and vice versa.

St Calculation:
St is inversely related to the supply of USD0++. In simpler terms, when the amount of USD0++ supply increases, the St value reduces, which lowers the minting rate of USUAL.

Ceiling of 1: If the supply of USD0++ ever falls below its initial supply (Supply++), the St factor is set to 1. This acts as a "floor" for the minting rate to ensure that minting doesn't get "too small" when the collateral supply is low.

If the supply (Supply++) exceeds the initial supply (the amount locked at launch), then St becomes a fraction less than 1. This prevents excessive minting as the total supply of USD0++ grows, thus adjusting the rate of USUAL minted to keep it in line with the supply however due to wrong computation of current balance will cause the st value to be equal to scalar one when the st value should be reduced 

    function _calculateSt(DistributionModuleStorageV0 storage $, uint256 supplyUSD0PP, uint256 pt)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        // NOTE: everything has 10^18 precision
        uint256 numerator = Math.mulDiv($.initialSupplyPp0, $.p0, SCALAR_ONE); // scaled by 10**18 * 10**18 / 10**18 = 10**18
        uint256 denominator = Math.mulDiv(supplyUSD0PP, pt, SCALAR_ONE); // scaled by 10**18 * 10**18 / 10**18 = 10**18
        // NOTE: Good up to 10_000_000_000_000 supply, 10_000_000_000 price, with 10**18 precision
        // NOTE: (2^256-1) > (10000000000000*10**18)*(10000000000*10**18)*10**18
        uint256 result = Math.mulDiv(SCALAR_ONE, numerator, denominator, Math.Rounding.Floor); // scales numerator by 10**18 then divides by 10**18 to keep the same scale


        return result < SCALAR_ONE ? result : SCALAR_ONE;
    }

while calculating the st the function first takes the initial supply which is recorded at the time of deployment

but while calculating the st the contract does not fetch the latest usdp supply which will result in a flawed st calculation as the supply will remain same in

 supplyUSD0PP is the current supply however both supplyUSD0PP and initialSupplyPp0 use the same supply while calculating st

as a result the initial supply and current supply value will remain the same leading to incorrect calculations if the current supply exceeds this will be highly problematic for the protocol as when the supply should be decreased the st will still continue to report wrong calculations

### Impact

when the supply exceeds the st should be reduced to reduce the supply however due to the wrong balance the st will continue to report wrong values leading to incorrect minting of tokens which is highly problematic this will affect the price of the token

### PoC

imagine a scenario
original USD0PP current supply = 350 million

flawed (supplyUSD0PP) which will be used while calculating st = 300,000,000
initialSupplyPp0 = 300,000,000 same as supplyusd0pp

(current price) pt = 0.90$
(initial price )p0 = 1 $

numerator = (300,000,000 * 1e18 * 1e18) / 1e18 = 300,000,000 * 1e18
denominator = (300,000,000 * 1e18 * 90 * 1e16) / 1e18 = 270,000,000 * 1e18
result = (1e18 * 300,000,000 * 1e18) / (270,000,000 * 1e18) = 1.1111e18

Since the calculated result (1.1111e18) is greater than SCALAR_ONE (1e18), the function will return SCALAR_ONE, which is 1e18
which is wrong

now lets calculate the st with the right values

initialSupplyPp0 = 300,000,000
USD0PP current supply = 350 million
(current price) pt = 0.90$
(initial price )p0 = 1 $


numerator = (300,000,000 * 1e18 * 1e18) / 1e18 = 300,000,000 * 1e18
denominator = (350,000,000 * 1e18 * 90 * 1e16) / 1e18 = 315,000,000 * 1e18
result = (1e18 * 300,000,000 * 1e18) / (315,000,000 * 1e18) = 0.9523e18

Since the calculated result (0.9523e18) is less than SCALAR_ONE (1e18), the function will return result

indicating that the supply should be reduced 






### Mitigation

fetch the current token supply while calculating st
