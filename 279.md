# Real-world assets backing USD0 can fall in value and lead to depegging of the stable coin

### Summary

While minting new usd0, its made sure that there is enough real-world assets [backing the newly minted usd0. ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0.sol#L127)However, there is no check to see if the usd0 is completely backed after minting. As the USYC RWA in this case is based of US treasury bills and can fall in value.

### Root Cause

In USD0, there are no mechanisms in place to handle the situation when there was USD0 minted for 1:1 ratio of real world assets however after some time the real-world assets backing the USD0 in circulation fell in value. While the mint function prohibits users to mint more USD0 tokens, It does not help say when the value ratio becomes 4:3 after RWA fell in value. 

There are no mechanisms in place to make it 1:1 as the RWA can drop in value. The backing isn't overcollaterised as well.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. RWA assets used by protocol for USD0 drop in value

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The backing isn't 1:1 and the ratio is heavily swinged by the drop in value of Real-world assets used in the backing. Losing a little of the innate worth of the token will more likely lead to the stable coin being depegged

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Have a mechanism to check anytime if the real-world assets backing the USD0 haven't fallen in price. If they don't match consider hacing 20% or a safe percentage to accomodate the drop in value and have lesser usd0 amounts [minted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0.sol#L134).
