# Lack of Zero Supply Check Allows Minting Zero Shares for Deposit

### Summary

The deposit flow does not check if `totalSupply` of shares is 0 before minting. If `totalSupply` == 0, calling deposit can result in minting zero shares for supplied assets. This creates a situation where the depositor holds no shares despite providing assets, effectively losing their deposit.

if the `UsualX` contract started receiving yield, then also the shares calculated will be 0
shares =  (asset * totalSupply) / totalAsset =>  shares  = 0

so if totalSupply == 0 , then shares minted should be equal to the deposited amount.

Deposit execution flow:- 
```solidity 
@> 1st from UsualX contract 
 function depositWithPermit(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
        try IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), assets, deadline, v, r, s) {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
            catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks

        return deposit(assets, receiver);
    }  
@> 2nd  ERC4626Upgradeable contract
  function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public virtual returns (uint256) {
        //
        uint256 maxAssets = maxDeposit(receiver);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxDeposit(receiver, assets, maxAssets);
        }

        uint256 shares = previewDeposit(assets);
        _deposit(_msgSender(), receiver, assets, shares);

        return shares;
    } 
@> 3rd call to YeildBearingVault contract
   function _deposit(address caller, address receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 shares)
        internal
        virtual
        override
    {
        YieldDataStorage storage $ = _getYieldDataStorage();
        // we MUST call it before any vault interactions
        _updateYield();
        super._deposit(caller, receiver, assets, shares);
        $.totalDeposits += assets;
    }  
@> call to ERC4626Updradeable contract deposit underlying token and mint shares
    function _deposit(address caller, address receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 shares) internal virtual {
        ERC4626Storage storage $ = _getERC4626Storage();
        // If _asset is ERC777, `transferFrom` can trigger a reentrancy BEFORE the transfer happens through the
        // `tokensToSend` hook. On the other hand, the `tokenReceived` hook, that is triggered after the transfer,
        // calls the vault, which is assumed not malicious.
        //
        // Conclusion: we need to do the transfer before we mint so that any reentrancy would happen before the
        // assets are transferred and before the shares are minted, which is a valid state.
        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-no-eth
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom($._asset, caller, address(this), assets);
        _mint(receiver, shares);

        emit Deposit(caller, receiver, assets, shares);
    }
```

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue to not check whether the totolSupply is 0, by ERC4626upgradeable contract and vault contract whether the shares calculated are zero 

### Internal pre-conditions

it's doesn't require any pre-condition, it's just  totalSupply == 0 so shares minted == 0. 

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. User who deposited into the vault Permanently loosing there deposit asset.

### PoC
1. User call deposit function = suppose 5e18 tokens
2. It will direct to upgradeable contract deposit, and calculated shares
3. as there totalSupply == 0 , shares calculated will be 0 


### Mitigation

1. Implement if the totalSupply == 0, mint asset equivalent shares
if (totalSupply == 0) {
    shares = assets;  // or some fixed minimum amount to ensure proper claim
}
4. implement virtual shares
5. implement require(shares ! = 0 )
