# Potential Front-running Vulnerability in setMaxChargeableTax Allowing Preemptive Tax Payment Before Increase

### Summary

The function `setMaxChargeableTax(uint256 tax)` in `AirdropTaxCollector` :: `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.sol#L149`  can be front-run, allowing a user to pay tax at a lower rate before a higher tax value is set. This front-running opportunity arises because thereâ€™s no mechanism to temporarily restrict tax payments while the setMaxChargeableTax function is in process.

As a result, users can exploit the timing of the tax adjustment, causing a potential revenue loss for the protocol. This situation enables users to evade the intended tax value and reduce their tax liability before the increase takes effect.

### Root Cause

In `AirdropTaxCollector.sol:149::setMaxChargeableTax(uint256 tax)` function, the absence of a mechanism to prevent front-running during the setMaxChargeableTax function execution is the root cause. This allows users to pay taxes at a lower rate immediately before a higher tax value is set, resulting in a potential revenue loss for the protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.`AIRDROP_OPERATOR_ROLE` calls `AirdropTaxCollector.sol:149::setMaxChargeableTax(uint256 tax)` function, with a `tax` value greater than `AirdropTaxCollector.sol:70 :: AirdropTaxCollectorStorage.maxChargeableTax` already on the chain.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

	1.	Attacker Monitoring: The attacker monitors transactions to detect when the setMaxChargeableTax function is about to be executed to increase the tax rate.
	2.	Front-Running the Tax Payment: Once the transaction to set a higher tax rate is observed in the mempool, the attacker immediately submits a transaction to pay their tax at the current, lower rate.
	3.	Manipulating Transaction Priority: To ensure their transaction is mined before the tax rate update, the attacker can set a higher gas price, giving it a higher priority in the transaction pool.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss in potential tax revenue due to front-running of the setMaxChargeableTax function. The attacker gains the advantage of paying a reduced tax rate before the intended increase.The attacker pays a lower tax rate before the update is executed, bypassing the intended new, higher tax rate. This results in a loss for the protocol as the intended tax revenue increase is avoided for these transactions.
