# the function clime will not properly work due to a check

### Summary

 in the contract  **AirdropDistribution** function **_available**  if the account is a  in the Top 80 it will calculate a Penalty  by calling  the function **_computePenalty** and this function will just try to calculate the **Penalty** by using  **$.penaltyPercentageByMonth**  the   problem here is that in line 203 if the **$.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month]** is **BASIS_POINT_BAS**  the   penalty amount will be one six of the amount  which is the **claimable** amount for each month  and it will return for the function **_available** the thing here is that in line 260  it even revert if the climbable amount minus **penaltyAmount** is equal to **totalClaimed** which will revert  be the case    for  every **$.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month]** = **BASIS_POINT_BASE** so one six of the amount as a penalty will cause an error which will lead to line 260   to revert for every 2 up to 6 months 
```solidity
 if (claimableAmount <= totalClaimed) {
            revert NothingToClaim();
        }
```
    

### Root Cause

 in  contract **AirdropDistribution* line  260   revert even if the claimable amount is   equal to climbed amount
