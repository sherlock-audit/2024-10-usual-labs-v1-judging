# The redeem function make Users spend double Fee

### Summary

The redeem function in `UsualX.sol` currently subtracts the withdrawal fee twice from the yieldStorage.totalDeposits balance. The fee is first deducted within the `super._withdraw` call and then again manually through the line `yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee`. This double deduction reduces the total deposits more than intended, leading to incorrect balances and potential loss of funds within the contract for the user.

### Impact

- Incorrect Balance of Total Deposits: Subtracting the fee twice causes the total deposits to be lower than they should be, potentially reducing available funds for other users and affecting overall system integrity.
- Increased Costs for Users: This double fee effectively reduces users' final withdrawal amounts more than expected, leading to unfair costs and losses for those redeeming shares.

### PoC

The following code demonstrates the issue:
```javascript
function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner)
    public
    override
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    returns (uint256 assets)
{
    YieldDataStorage storage yieldStorage = _getYieldDataStorage();

    // Check redemption limit
    uint256 maxShares = maxRedeem(owner);
    if (shares > maxShares) {
        revert ERC4626ExceededMaxRedeem(owner, shares, maxShares);
    }

    // Calculate assets after fee
    assets = previewRedeem(shares);
    uint256 assetsWithoutFee = convertToAssets(shares);
    uint256 fee = assetsWithoutFee - assets;

    // Perform redemption
   @> super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);

    // Take the fee (redundant second deduction)
  @>  yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
}
```
In this code, the fee is subtracted twice: once inside super._withdraw (which already deducts the fee) and again manually with yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee, leading to the double deduction.

### Mitigation

To fix this, remove the manual deduction of the fee in yieldStorage.totalDeposits after super._withdraw, as the fee is already deducted in the _withdraw function.
