# {actor} will {impact} {affected party}unsafe airdrop minting using mint instead of safemint

### Summary
here is the link to the function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L314

in airdropdistribution.sol the claim function uses mint to mint the users asset to their address.this can result in airdrops being sent to addresses that do not support erc20 tokens, causing them to become irretrievable. To prevent this, safeMint() should be used instead to ensure that the recipient address can safely receive the airdrop.

 $.claimed[account] += amountToClaim + penaltyAmount;
 @>       $.usualToken.mint(account, amountToClaim);
        emit Claimed(account, amountToClaim);
    }


function claim(address account, bool isTop80, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
    {
        if (account == address(0)) {
            revert NullAddress();
        }
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert AmountIsZero();
        }

        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $ = _airdropDistributionStorageV0();

        if (!_verifyMerkleProof($, account, isTop80, amount, proof)) {
            revert InvalidProof();
        }

        if ($.ragequit[account]) {
            revert AirdropVoided();
        }

        (uint256 amountToClaim, uint256 penaltyAmount) = _available($, account, amount, isTop80);

        $.claimed[account] += amountToClaim + penaltyAmount;
     @>   $.usualToken.mint(account, amountToClaim);
        emit Claimed(account, amountToClaim);
    }

### Root Cause

in airdropdistribution.sol the mint do not check if the address of the user supports erc20  token before sending the tokens, which can lead to loss of funds
Using _safeMint() instead ensures that the recipient address is either an externally owned account (EOA) or a contract that properly implements the ERC20 receiver interface, preventing this kind of issue

### Internal pre-conditions

permanent Loss of airdrop, If an airdrop is minted to a contract that does not support ERC20 tokens, it could be permanently lost or locked, with no way to retrieve it

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

IF a user calls the claim function with an address that do not support erc20 tokens, the token will be lost. If tokens are minted directly to a contract that cannot handle them, those tokens may be effectively lost.

_No response_

### Impact

The use of _mint() directly sends the airdrop to the specified address without verifying whether the recipient can receive ERC20 tokens. If the recipient is a contract that does not implement the ERC20 Receiver interface, the airdrop will be locked in that contract and become irretrievable

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use safeMint Instead of mint Replace all instances of mint with safeMint to ensure that the recipient is capable of receiving ERC20 tokens.
