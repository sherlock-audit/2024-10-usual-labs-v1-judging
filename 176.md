# UsualOracle Accepts Stale Oracle Data

### Summary

Despite checking if the answer is 0 to ensure the data is good, and checking timeout in initialization, UsualOracle does not check for staleness of the Oracle data. If the Oracle is lagging behind, this could cause major problems in pricing by allowing inaccurate values into the system.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/oracles/UsualOracle.sol#L99 latestRoundData here checks if the answer is above 0, but does not check for timeout (despite timeout being checked in initialize and saved on the contract) as it does in other contracts such as ClassicalOracle https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L88

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

If Oracle is down for a certain amount of time, it will begin returning bad values but the contract has no protection against that.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Could cause disastrous loss in the protocol if oracle values are stale.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a staleness check like the other oracle contracts have.
