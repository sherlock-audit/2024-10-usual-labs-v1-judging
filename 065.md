# Temporary DOS when claiming airdrops

### Summary
In decentralized protocols, airdrop mechanisms are commonly used to distribute tokens to a wide user base. This distribution is often implemented with claim functions in smart contracts that allow eligible users to retrieve their allocated tokens. However, suppose such a function relies on the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which restricts function execution when the contract is paused. In that case, it may inadvertently block users from claiming their tokens during critical claim periods.

### Vulnerability Details
The `whenNotPaused` modifier is a standard modifier often employed in contracts to add a layer of security. By ensuring specific functions are executable only when the contract is not paused, it mitigates risks associated with potential attacks, exploits, or maintenance requirements. This modifier’s primary use is to provide protocol operators the ability to temporarily halt operations in the face of unexpected or malicious events.

However, in a claim function, this modifier may introduce risks. Specifically, if the contract is paused at any point during an airdrop’s claim period, eligible users might face restrictions when attempting to claim their tokens.
```solidity
 function claim(address account, bool isTop80, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
    {
        if (account == address(0)) {
            revert NullAddress();
        }
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert AmountIsZero();
        }

        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $ = _airdropDistributionStorageV0();

        if (!_verifyMerkleProof($, account, isTop80, amount, proof)) {
            revert InvalidProof();
        }

        if ($.ragequit[account]) {
            revert AirdropVoided();
        }

        (uint256 amountToClaim, uint256 penaltyAmount) = _available($, account, amount, isTop80);

        $.claimed[account] += amountToClaim + penaltyAmount;
        $.usualToken.mint(account, amountToClaim);
        emit Claimed(account, amountToClaim);
    }
```

#### Impact 
If the contract is paused, users cannot execute the claim function due to the [whenNotPaused](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L316) restriction. Since airdrop claims are often time-limited, this restriction could result in users being unable to claim their tokens within the specified period.






### Recommedation
Adjust the `whenNotPaused` modifier to exempt the claim function, allowing users to proceed with claims regardless of the contract’s paused state.
