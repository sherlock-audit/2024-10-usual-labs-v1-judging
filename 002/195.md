# Front-Running Vulnerability in Blacklist Function Allows Unauthorized Token Transfers

### Summary

The `blacklist(address account)` [function ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usual.sol#L162)in Usual.sol can be exploited due to a potential front-running vulnerability. This function, which adds an account to the blacklist to restrict specific operations, does not prevent an account from being preemptively targeted in a way that allows malicious actors to front-run the blacklist transaction.

In the current implementation, the function checks if an account is already blacklisted and then proceeds to blacklist it if it isn’t. However, because it lacks any mechanism to prevent front-running, an attacker aware that their account is about to be blacklisted could front-run this function by calling sensitive functions—such as transferring or redeeming tokens—before the blacklist is applied. This could allow the malicious actor to execute unauthorized token transfers or withdrawals from the protocol right before they lose access, undermining the security intent of the blacklist mechanism.

This vulnerability could result in a breach of the intended restrictions on blacklisted accounts, exposing the protocol to potential losses.

### Root Cause

In Usual.sol:162, the blacklist function does not have a mechanism to prevent front-running, allowing malicious actors to execute unauthorized actions before their account is blacklisted.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `BLACKLIST_ROLE` calls `blacklist(address account)` on `Usual.sol` contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

	1.	Malicious Actor detects the pending blacklist action through transaction monitoring.
	2.	Malicious Actor front-runs the blacklist transaction by submitting a transaction with higher gas to execute any restricted or sensitive actions that would be blocked once blacklisted.
	3.	Malicious Actor manages to complete unauthorized actions such as token transfers or interactions with restricted contract functions before the blacklist transaction is processed, exploiting the lack of an immediate block on their actions.

### Impact

Impact

The protocol suffers a severe security breach as unauthorized actors can front-run the blacklist action, leading to a loss of user trust and protocol integrity. The malicious actor gains full unrestricted access, potentially siphoning off user funds, initiating unauthorized transactions, or interacting with sensitive contract functions, causing irreparable damage to protocol assets and reputation. The affected parties face potential losses of up to 100% of their assets, with attackers capitalizing on this vulnerability to execute high-value unauthorized actions right before the blacklist takes effect.
