# Potential Front-Running Vulnerability in Blacklist Function Allowing Pre-Blacklist Transactions

### Summary

The [blacklist function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L156) in UsualX contract presents a potential front-running vulnerability that could allow a targeted account to perform transactions immediately before being blacklisted. This function is intended to restrict certain accounts by adding them to a blacklist, preventing further interactions with the protocol. However, since the function relies on external transactions for execution, an account facing blacklisting could monitor for the blacklist transaction and swiftly initiate transactions—such as transferring or withdrawing funds—prior to the blacklist status being applied.

Without a mechanism to ensure transactions cannot be initiated during the blacklisting process, accounts targeted for blacklisting can circumvent the restriction by conducting critical interactions with the protocol, nullifying the intended enforcement of the blacklist. This vulnerability could compromise the integrity of the blacklist functionality and result in unauthorized transactions.

### Root Cause

In UsualX.sol, the blacklist function lacks a mechanism to prevent front-running, allowing targeted accounts to execute transactions before the blacklist restriction takes effect.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `BLACKLIST_ROLE` calls `blacklist(address account)` on `UsualX` contract with `account` being attacker's account

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

	1.	Before the transaction is mined and the attacker account is blacklisted, the attacker account is alerted to the impending action due to the public nature of blockchain transactions.
	2.	Attacker Account rapidly initiates transactions (e.g., transferring assets, executing specific functions) to bypass the impending restriction.
	3.	The Attacker account successfully executes these transactions, avoiding the blacklist’s intended limitations before the blacklist function call is confirmed on the blockchain.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a substantial security risk and potential reputational damage as blacklisting fails to enforce account restrictions immediately. The attacker exploits this delay, gaining the ability to transfer assets or execute critical functions just before restrictions are enforced. This circumvention enables the attacker to secure unauthorized benefits and escape intended controls, putting the protocol’s integrity at risk and potentially resulting in financial loss or erosion of user trust.
