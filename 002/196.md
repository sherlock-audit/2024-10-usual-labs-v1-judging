# Front-Running Vulnerability in blacklist Function Allows Restricted Actions Before Blacklisting

### Summary

The [blacklist function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualS.sol#L164) in the UsualS.sol contract is vulnerable to a front-running attack, allowing malicious actors to perform restricted actions just before their account is blacklisted. When an account is designated for blacklisting, there’s no immediate effect that prevents this account from making calls to other sensitive contract functions until the blacklist transaction is fully processed and included in a block.

Since front-running allows transactions to be reordered or delayed, a malicious actor aware of an impending blacklisting could exploit this by executing potentially harmful transactions, such as transferring tokens or calling other privileged functions, before the blacklisting takes effect. This delay window poses a risk to the integrity of the system, as blacklisted accounts are intended to have no further interaction with the contract.

The blacklist function lacks a pre-execution lock or immediate restriction mechanism upon initiation, leaving it susceptible to this vulnerability.

### Root Cause

In UsualS.sol: blacklist::164 line  function, there is no immediate effect upon initiating a blacklist action, allowing transactions to be front-run before the blacklist is enforced. This delay permits a malicious actor to execute sensitive functions before blacklisting fully takes effect.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `BLACKLIST_ROLE` calls `blacklist(address account)` on `UsualS.sol` contract with `account` value as malicious actor's account address.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

	1.	Malicious actor detects the impending blacklist transaction in the mempool blacklisting his account.
	2.	Malicious actor quickly submits a transaction that calls functions like transfer or withdraw, leveraging the account’s full privileges.

### Impact

The protocol and its users suffer an approximate loss of account integrity and security. [The attacker gains unrestricted access to transfer or withdraw assets before blacklist restrictions apply, resulting in significant unauthorized funds transfer.]
