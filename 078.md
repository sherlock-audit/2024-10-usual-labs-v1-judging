# The Attacker can claim airdrops on behalf of an account, causing unwanted penalties to users

### Summary

The `AirdropDistribution.claim()` function doesn't verify that the passed `account` parameter actually belongs to the caller, meaning anyone can call it on behalf of any account, triggering an early claim and forcing account to lose a percentage of total rewardAmount in penalties. 

### Root Cause

Users who claim early are likely to receive penalties, considering the address is in the top 80% of the distribution. There is six month vesting period where with each month passed, claimers can redeem 1/6th of total reward amount with a penality proportional to the `monthPassed`. Either they claim early and incur penalties, or they wait six months to pass and claim without penalties. But the issue is the function `claim()` doesn't verify whether `msg.sender` is the account owner, result in anyone can call the function on behalf of that account causing early penalties to their account.

### Attack Path

1. Alice as an eligible airdrop claimer choose to hold onto their reward tokens until six month passed(note I assume sets penalties would be drop after 6 month as discussed with sponser in disc. as well)
2. However, Bob as an malignant user choose to claim on Alice behalf during six month, forcing Alice to receive penalties, 

### Impact

Potential funds loss for alice. 

### Mitigation
Call can be restricted to account owner only,
```diff
    function claim(address account, bool isTop80, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
    {
+       if (msg.sender != account) {
+           revert NotAuthorized(); 
+       }
        if (account == address(0)) {
            revert NullAddress();
        }
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert AmountIsZero();
        }

        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $ = _airdropDistributionStorageV0();
        ...snip...
    }
