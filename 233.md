# Burner cannot burn shares from blacklisted accounts

### Summary

The usual documentation properly states in the token contracts description:
_mint(address_ to, uint256 amount): Mints tokens to a non-blacklisted address if the caller has the USD0_MINT role._

_burn(uint256 amount) and burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount): Burns tokens from an address, requiring the USD0_BURN role._

From what is stated we can understand that USD0_BURN role might want to burn from blacklisted addresses and that will be impossible because of the overriden update() function `_update(...)`:
```solidity
function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        internal
        virtual
        override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable, ERC20Upgradeable)
    {
        Usd0StorageV0 storage $ = _usd0StorageV0();
        if ($.isBlacklisted[from] || $.isBlacklisted[to]) { // @audit it will revert when trying to burn the tokens of a blacklisted address
            revert Blacklisted();
        }
        super._update(from, to, amount);
    }
```
I will take `usd0` as example but it also happens in other token contracts
If someone granted the BLACKLIST_ROLE role blacklists an address that has some tokens, someone with USD0_BURN role will not be able to burn tokens from that blacklisted address, he will have to inform the BLACKLIST_ROLE role about it to `unBlacklist(...)` the address and burn the tokens of the address, but if the malicious user that was blacklisted knows about this he can front-run the `burn(...)` and transfer the tokens to another address and that would be an issue.
It's quite similar to this issue: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-ondo-findings/issues/136

### Root Cause
This check will revert when trying to burn from a blaclisted address:

### Internal pre-conditions

1. BLACKLIST_ROLE blacklists malicious user address that has some tokens
2. USD0_BURN tries to burn the blacklisted malicious user address through `burnFrom(...)` but fails
3. USD0_BURN signals the issue to BLACKLIST_ROLE
4. BLACKLIST_ROLE calls `unBlacklist(...)` to unblacklist the malicious user address to allow the burner to burn the tokens
5. USD0_BURN tries to burn malicious user's tokens through `burnFrom(...)`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user sees he's been unblacklisted and front-run the `burnFrom(...)` to send his tokens to another address
2. `burnFrom(...)` reverts

### Impact

The protocol will be unable to burn tokens to regulate the `totalSupply()` for example, assigned roles will not be able to perform as they're supposed to

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a transfer from the address you wish to blacklist to a trusted address that belongs to the protocol inside the `blacklist(...)` function
