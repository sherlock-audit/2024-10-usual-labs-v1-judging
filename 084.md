# Mint/Burn operations can be frontrunning using oracle prices

### Summary

Due to delays in oracle price updates, which may occur after a set percentage deviation or a specific interval, attackers can observe pending oracle transactions in the mempool and strategically front-run them. This gives attackers an opportunity to mint or burn stablecoins at manipulated prices before the real-world price is fully reflected in the oracle.

### Root Cause

The Oracle price can not be trusted as the real-time price.

For example, the BTC/USD and ETH/USD price feeds on mainnet have a "Deviation threshold" of 0.5%, meaning that the price will only be updated once the price movement exceeds 0.5% within the heartbeat period.

Say if the previous price point for WETH is 1000 USD, the price will only be updated once the price goes up to more than 1005 USD or down to less than 995 USD.

### Impact

When the market price of WETH is lower than the oracle price, it is possible to mint 1000 USSD by using 1 WETH and selling it to DAI, causing the quality of the collateral for USD0 to continuously decrease and the value to be leaked to the arbitragers.

### Mitigation

This is a complicated problem to solve, but potential solutions involve adding a small fee to mint/burn operations to make the frequent minting/burning which occurs in sandwich attacks less profitable.
