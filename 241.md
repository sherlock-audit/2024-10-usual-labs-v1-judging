# taxPayer can early unlock their bonds using `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice()`.



### Summary

Users who paid the tax are allowed to claim their complete amount  from the `airdropDistributionModule` but they are not allowed to unlock their bonds before maturity that is `4 years`. This is enforced by the protocol by setting `bondEarlyUnlockDisabled` = `true` for the users when they pay the `tax`.[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.sol#L273).

there are 2 function in the `usd0pp.sol` that allows users to unlock their bonds prematurely.
1. `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice(uint256 usd0ppAmount)`
2. `temporaryOneToOneExitUnwrap(uint256 amountToUnwrap)`

`bondEarlyUnlockDisabled[account] != true` condition is checked in `temporaryOneToOneExitUnwrap()`.

But the `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice(uint256 usd0ppAmount)` ,due to the missing check , allows anyone inclduing the `taxpayers` to unlock their bonds by receivng the floor amount.

### Root Cause
 
 Taxpayers can early unlock their bonds due to the missing `bondEarlyUnlockDisabled[account] != true` check in `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice()`


### Internal pre-conditions
A user has paid the tax to be avaialable to claim the full amount from the airdrop.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User has paid the tax.
2. He avails his full amount from the airdrop.
3. He calls `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice()` to unlock his bond prematurely.

### Impact

Taxpayers can claim the entire amount from the `airdropDistrbution` and can also unlock their bonds prematurely.

### PoC
_No response_

### Mitigation

add `bondEarlyUnlockDisabled[account] != true` check in the unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice(uint256 usd0ppAmount).
