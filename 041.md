# rewardAmount is not scaled to 1e18  which causes rewardRate to round down.


### Summary

In  ``RewardAccrualBase:_startRewardDistribuition``, the rewardAmount is not scaled to 1e18 which causes ``rewardRate ``to round down to 0 .

### Root Cause

In ``RewardAccrualBase:L216``,rounding error causes rewardRate to be 0 . 

### Internal pre-conditions
_No response_


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
 
1. operator should call `distributeUsualToBuckets`  calls to  ``_distributeToUsualStarBucket`` .
2. RewardDistribution will be started but 0 amout will be sent due to rounding.
 

### Impact
loss of rewards for users.


### PoC

Consider, the rewardAmount to be less than a 86400 as the duration is 1 day.

```solidity 
$.rewardRate = 5000 / 86400 = 0
uint256 adjustedAmount = $.rewardRate * 86400 = 0 
$.rewardToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), adjustedAmount);

```
here , 0 rewardToken will sent to vault. 


### Mitigation

To prevent the rounding error , rewardAmount should be scaled to 1e18 before calculating `rewardRate`.

```diff
uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
-- $.rewardRate = rewardAmount / duration;
++ $.rewardRate = (rewardAmount * 1e18) / duration;


-- uint256 adjustedAmount = $.rewardRate * duration;
++ uint256 adjustedAmount = ($.rewardRate * duration) / 1e18;

$.rewardAmount = adjustedAmount;
```
