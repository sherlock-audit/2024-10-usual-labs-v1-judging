# `_updateRewards` isn't called in `UsualSP::removeOriginalAllocation()` which leads to loss of funds for the user

### Summary

`_updateRewads` is an internal function which is responisble for rewards calculation in the `UsualSP` contract. User's rewards are calculated based on their's `balanceOf`. `balanceOf` function accounts for `liquidAllocation` + `originalAllocation` - `originalClaimed`. It means that users that were set as `originalAllocation` beneficients should earn rewards based on their `originalAllocation` balance. 

When admin calls `allocate` the `_updateRewards` is called before assigning `originalAllocation` to the user. However, when the `removeOriginalAllocation` is called the `_updateRewards` function isn't called, which leads to a scenario where the user was eligible for rewards for the time he had the `originalAllocation` assigned but will not receive any rewards because the `_updateRewards` wasn't called before removing the allocation for the user's address.

### Root Cause

The `_updateRewards` isn't called in `removeOriginalAllocation` function. The rewards calculations are incorrect and the user will not receive the tokens which he earned for the time he had `originalAllocation`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `allocate` must be called, increasing user's `originalAllocation` balance.
2. Some time must pass
3. `removeOriginalAllocation` must be called, removing user's `originalAllocation` balance

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None, steps explained in internal pre-conditions. It's not an attack path rather a normal usage.

### Impact

User can lose up to 100% of the rewards earned from `originalAllocation`.

### PoC

We can see that `removeOriginalAllocation` doesn't call `_updateRewards`:

```javascript
function removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients) external {
        if (recipients.length == 0) {
            revert InvalidInputArraysLength();
        }

        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE);

        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
            $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
            $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;

            emit RemovedOriginalAllocation(recipients[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

### Mitigation

Call `_updateRewards` for every recipients in the same way it is done in `allocate` function.

```diff
function removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients) external {
        if (recipients.length == 0) {
            revert InvalidInputArraysLength();
        }

        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE);

        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
++          _updateReward(recipients[i]);
            $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
            $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;

            emit RemovedOriginalAllocation(recipients[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
