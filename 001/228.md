# Reward is not updated during `removeOriginalAllocation`

### Summary

In the `UsualSP` contract, rewards are calculated based on the user's staked amount. Users have the ability to stake or unstake tokens, with their effective balance determined by the sum of `amountStakedByUser + originalAllocation - originalClaimed`. The `originalAllocation` value can be modified by a user with the `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` by calling the `allocate` function. Meanwhile, `originalClaimed` indicates the portion of allocated tokens already claimed by the user. However, an issue arises when `removeOriginalAllocation` is called: the rewards for accounts from which allocation is removed do not get updated accordingly.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the missing reward update call within `removeOriginalAllocation`. Specifically, there is no call to `_updateReward(recipients[i]);` to adjust the reward balance when an allocation is removed, causing rewards to remain outdated for affected users.

### Impact

Users whose allocations are removed experience a reward calculation discrepancy, with their accumulated rewards not reflecting the removal.
This oversight can lead to a financial loss for affected users, as their entitled rewards may be understated, impacting the contract’s fairness and accuracy in distributing rewards.

### PoC

Consider the following setup:
- **User's balance:** 100, comprising:
  - **50 tokens staked.**
  - **60 tokens as original allocation.**
  - **10 tokens already claimed.**
- **Current `rewardPerToken`:** `10 * 1e24`.
- **User's `lastRewardPerTokenUsed`:** `3 * 1e24`.

If the `_updateReward` function is not called when `removeOriginalAllocation` is executed, the user's reward balance will not include the correct additional reward from the 7 * 1e24 multiplier on their balance of 100 tokens. Here’s how this oversight affects the reward calculation.

1. **Expected Reward Calculation (with `_updateReward`)**

   When `_updateReward` is properly called, the user's reward would increase based on the difference between `rewardPerToken` and `lastRewardPerTokenUsed`.

   $$
   \text{Reward Adjustment} = (\text{rewardPerToken} - \text{lastRewardPerTokenUsed}) \times \text{user's balance}
   $$

   Plugging in the values:

   $$
   \text{Reward Adjustment} = (10 * 1e24 - 3 * 1e24) * 100 / 1e24 = 7 * 1e24 * 100 / 1e24 = 700 * 1e24 / 1e24 = 
   $$

   So, if `_updateReward` is called, the user's reward would increase by `700`.

2. **Current Buggy Behavior (without `_updateReward`)**

   Without calling `_updateReward`, this adjustment of `700` will not be applied to the user's reward balance. As a result, the user’s accumulated reward remains inaccurate, leading to a potential loss.

3. **User Re-stakes in the Same Block After Allocation Removal**

After calling `removeOriginalAllocation`, if the user stakes in the same block the amount of 10, the reward will be calculated

- **Users balance** 50 tokens.
- **Reward calculation:** The reward will be incorrectly calculated based only on this 50-token stake, but the user should have received rewards based on the total 100-token balance before the allocation removal.

The new reward will be:

$$
\text{New Reward} = 50 \times 1e24 \times 7 / 1e24= 350
$$

Thus, instead of getting the full reward of `700` based on their full balance of 100 tokens, the user will only receive `350` due to the missed reward update before the remove allocation.

### Mitigation

```diff
function removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients) external {
        if (recipients.length == 0) {
            revert InvalidInputArraysLength();
        }

        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE);

        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
 +         _updateReward(recipients[i]);
            $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
            $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;

            emit RemovedOriginalAllocation(recipients[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
