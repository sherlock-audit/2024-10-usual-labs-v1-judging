# Rewards are not updated for the removed allocations in the UsualSP.removeOriginalAllocation() function

### Summary
The Usual staking contract (UsualSP) has a vulnerability where users whose original vested allocations are removed can earn unfair additional rewards.
This occurs because the vested allocations are considered staked and earn rewards, but removing the original allocation decreases the staking balance without updating the reward state.
In the UsualSP contract, vested allocations are treated as staked balances and earn staking rewards. However, the [removeOriginalAllocation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L367-L384) function does not update the user's reward state before removing allocations.

### Root Cause
The user's original allocation is counted as part of their balance. At [L376-L377](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L376-L377), the original allocation and the original claimed amount are both set to `0`, which results in a change to the user's balance. However, it does not update the rewards for the user.

```solidity
    function removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients) external {
        [...]
        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
376:        $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
377:        $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;
        [...]
        }
    }

    function balanceOf(address account) public view override returns (uint256) { 
        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
445:    return
446:        $.liquidAllocation[account] + $.originalAllocation[account] - $.originalClaimed[account];
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions
The original allocation for the user is removed.

### External pre-conditions
`$Usual` tokens are regulary distributed to the `UsualSP` contract.

### Attack Path
N/A

### Impact
Users whose original allocations have been removed can earn unfair additional rewards, resulting in the dilution of rewards for other users.

### PoC
N/A

### Mitigation
It is recommended to modify the code as follows:
```diff
    function removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients) external {
        [...]
        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
+           _updateReward(recipients[i]); 
376:        $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
377:        $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;
        [...]
        }
    }
```
