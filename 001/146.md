# UsualSP.sol::removeOriginalAllocation() - Users rewards are not updated before allocation is removed

### Summary

The `_updateReward` function is not called when a user's allocation is removed, causing the user to lose all of their recent rewards.

### Root Cause

Users accumulate rewards for their staked amount and their allocation. The [_updateReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/modules/RewardAccrualBase.sol#L158-L166) should be called on every user's action to store users' most recently accumulated rewards. 

The protocol can remove the user's allocation with `removeOriginalAllocation` which will stop rewards accumulation on the allocation. 
```js
    function removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients) external {
        if (recipients.length == 0) {
            revert InvalidInputArraysLength();
        }

        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE);

        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
            $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
            $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;

            emit RemovedOriginalAllocation(recipients[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
The problem here is that the `_updateReward()` is not called before the allocation is cleared, making the user lose his last accumulated rewards.
