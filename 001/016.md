# A missing reward update in UsualSP::removeOriginalAllocation will cause reduced reward accumulation for users

### Summary

The missing reward update in `removeOriginalAllocation` will cause a reduction in reward accumulation for users as the contract directly resets the `originalAllocation` variable without first updating rewards.

### Root Cause

In UsualSP.sol:376, the code in the `removeOriginalAllocation` function resets `$.originalAllocation` to zero without first updating rewards. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L376

```solidity
        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
            $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
            $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;

            emit RemovedOriginalAllocation(recipients[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
```
This causes an unintended reward loss as the `balanceOf` calculation, used for accruing rewards, will reference a reduced allocation amount on subsequent reward claims.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `removeOriginalAllocation` is called on an address that has an active reward allocation.
2. `balanceOf` calculation for reward accrual depends on `$.originalAllocation`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L443-L447

```solidity
    function balanceOf(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        return
            $.liquidAllocation[account] + $.originalAllocation[account] - $.originalClaimed[account];
    }
```

### External pre-conditions

1. The protocol is running an active reward accrual period.

### Attack Path

1. The operator calls `removeOriginalAllocation` on a recipient without first updating the reward.
2. The `originalAllocation` value for the recipient is reset to zero in storage.
3. When the recipient calls `claimReward`, the calculation in `_earned` references a reduced `balanceOf` due to `originalAllocation == 0`, leading to lower rewards.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/modules/RewardAccrualBase.sol#L136

```solidity
    function _earned(address account) internal view virtual returns (uint256 earned) {
        RewardAccrualBaseStorageV0 storage $ = _getRewardAccrualBaseDataStorage();
        uint256 accountBalance = balanceOf(account);
        uint256 rewardDelta = $.rewardPerTokenStored - $.lastRewardPerTokenUsed[account];
        earned = accountBalance.mulDiv(rewardDelta, 1e24, Math.Rounding.Floor) + $.rewards[account]; // 1e24 for precision loss
    }
```

### Impact

The users experience a reduced reward accumulation as their `originalAllocation` is zeroed out before updating rewards. This impacts the accuracy of rewards distribution and results in reward loss for affected users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `_updateReward(recipients[i])` in the `removeOriginalAllocation` function before resetting `$.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0`. This ensures rewards are fully accrued based on the prior allocation.

            $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;

            emit RemovedOriginalAllocation(recipients[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
