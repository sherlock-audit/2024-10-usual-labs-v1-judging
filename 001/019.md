# Loss of Reward for recipients when RemoveOriginalAllocation is called

### Summary

The `removeOriginalAllocation` function in the UsualSP smart contract is vulnerable to causing reward loss for recipients. When this function is called, it resets the user's allocation without updating their rewards, resulting in the loss of accumulated rewards within the allowed period. This issue arises due to the absence of an `_updateReward` call before resetting the recipient's allocation in the `removeOriginalAllocation` function.

### Root Cause

- **Function Affected**: `removeOriginalAllocation`
- **Root Cause**: The function `removeOriginalAllocation` does not call `_updateReward` for each recipient before setting their allocation and claimed amounts to zero. This omission leads to the permanent loss of any unclaimed rewards that the user accrued until the moment of reset.
- **Explanation**: While the `allocate` function calls `_updateReward` before updating the recipient's balance, this is missing in `removeOriginalAllocation`. As a result, when `removeOriginalAllocation` is executed, it clears the original allocation and claimed amounts without preserving the recipient’s accrued rewards. This can lead to an unintended loss of rewards, as any pending rewards are disregarded.

### Code Analysis

1. **Code Section from `allocate`**:
  
 ```solidity
   _updateReward(recipients[i]); // Updates rewards before modifying allocations
   $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = originalAllocations[i];
   ```

2. **Code Section from `removeOriginalAllocation`**:
  
 ```solidity
   $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
   $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;
 
  ```
  
 - This code resets `originalAllocation` and `originalClaimed` without updating the rewards.

3. **Impact of Omitting `_updateReward` in `removeOriginalAllocation`**:
 

  - Without calling `_updateReward` for each recipient, any rewards accumulated up to that point are lost when `originalAllocation` is set to zero.

 ```solidity
function _earned(address account) internal view virtual returns (uint256 earned) {
        RewardAccrualBaseStorageV0 storage $ = _getRewardAccrualBaseDataStorage();

 @audit>>       uint256 accountBalance = balanceOf(account);
    
       uint256 rewardDelta = $.rewardPerTokenStored - $.lastRewardPerTokenUsed[account];
        earned = accountBalance.mulDiv(rewardDelta, 1e24, Math.Rounding.Floor) + $.rewards[account]; // 1e24 for precision loss
    }

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The failure to update rewards before resetting allocations can result in the loss of all pending rewards for recipients.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, add an `_updateReward` call within the `removeOriginalAllocation` function before resetting the recipient’s allocation values. This ensures that the rewards are calculated and preserved up to the moment of reset.

### Suggested Code Fix

Add `_updateReward` for each recipient in `removeOriginalAllocation`:
```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
    _updateReward(recipients[i]); // Preserve accumulated rewards
    $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
    $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;

    emit RemovedOriginalAllocation(recipients[i]);
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```
