# The withdrawal and deposit in UsualX lack slippage control.

### Summary

UsualX is an ERC-4626 rewards vault, but its `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `redeem` functions lack slippage control. As a result, users may be vulnerable to front-running attacks, leading them to receive fewer shares or assets than expected during interactions.
