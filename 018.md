# Miscalculation of Fee in the Withdraw function in UsualX.sol

### Summary

A miscalculation in the fee deduction logic within the `withdraw` function of the UsualX smart contract leads to a potential loss of approximately 6.25% of funds from the total amount withdrawn. This issue arises due to an inconsistency between the fee calculations in the `withdraw` and `previewWithdraw` functions. This vulnerability could result in substantial fund loss for the protocol and it impact total deposit also which impact the shares calculation in the subsequent withdraw/deposit/redeem/mint call


### Root Cause

- **Function Affected**: `withdraw`
- **Root Cause**:

 Incorrect calculation of the withdrawal fee when users withdraw assets, especially the maximum amount. The formula in `withdraw` does not align with the correct fee calculation used in the `previewWithdraw` function.


- **Explanation**: 

The `withdraw` function recalculates the fee based on the amount passed by the user, which is inaccurate when the user withdraws. The current `withdraw` fee calculation does not consider the total assets with the fee included, leading to a reduced fee deduction than intended. For example Consequently, users withdrawing the maximum amount will have the max fee deducted from their account but not correctly aligned when recalculated, impacting the protocol's revenue.

For EXAMPLE

Amount in balance = $100
fee 25% = $25

MAX ASSET = $75

### Code Analysis

1. **Code Section from `withdraw`**:
  
 ```solidity
  function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
        public
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        YieldDataStorage storage yieldStorage = _getYieldDataStorage();

        // Check withdrawal limit
@AUDIT        >>    uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
       
@AUDIT        >>      if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
        }
   ```

 ```solidity
@AUDIT          >>       function maxWithdraw(address owner) public view override returns (uint256) {
        return previewRedeem(balanceOf(owner));
    }
 ```

 ```solidity
  function previewRedeem(uint256 shares) public view override returns (uint256 assets) {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        // Calculate the raw amount of assets for the given shares
        uint256 assetsWithoutFee = convertToAssets(shares);

        // Calculate and subtract the withdrawal fee
        uint256 fee =
            Math.mulDiv(assetsWithoutFee, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

@AUDIT          >>            assets = assetsWithoutFee - fee;

    }
 ```
 ```solidity
  function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
        public
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {

       // Calculate shares needed
        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);


 @AUDIT          >> ERROR>>       uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

        // Perform withdrawal (exact assets to receiver)
        super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);

        // take the fee
@AUDIT          >> ERROR>>         yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;

 ```

 - This code calculates the fee based on the assets requested for withdrawal, which does not factor in the total assets with the fee included.



Based on the EXAMPLE above 



Fee will be = (75 * 25 )/ 100 = $18.75

as against the actual fee of  $25
 

   
2. **Code Section from `previewWithdraw`**:
  
 ```solidity

@AUDIT          >>    uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

   uint256 assetsWithFee = assets + fee;
   shares = _convertToShares(assetsWithFee, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
   ```
   - Here, the `previewWithdraw` function correctly calculates the fee based on the assets including the fee, which ensures an accurate fee deduction.

### Impact

This vulnerability resultS in an estimated 6.25% OR MORE  revenue loss for the protocol per withdrawal. If unaddressed, this could lead to substantial financial loss, especially if large amounts are withdrawn frequently. As the README indicates that fees are expected to be implemented in a future update, this issue could become critical once fee withdrawal is enabled. - https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/575?filter=questions#:~:text=We%20are%20choosing,e.%20burned%2C%20redistributed)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, the fee calculation in the `withdraw` function should be updated to match the calculation logic in the `previewWithdraw` function. Specifically:

1. **Align Fee Calculation in `withdraw`**: Update the fee deduction logic to consider the total assets, including the fee, as calculated in `previewWithdraw`.
   
   ```solidity
         shares = previewWithdraw(assets);

--       uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);


++   uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil
++   );
   ```
