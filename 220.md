# tax paying users will receive very less amount

### Summary

when a top 80% user who didnt pay tax calls claim the airdrop calculates the amount they should receive like this

with every passing month the amount user will receive will increase

now when a user who decides to pay tax can claim the full amount in one go

this calculation design will lead to tax payers receiving very less compared to users who didnt pay which cant be the intended behavior as the docs mention that user will pay a tax and penalty but theres no such mention that the tax payer will receive very less amount compared to non tax payers 

### Root Cause

### Impact

users will receive very less than non tax payers which is not mentioned in the docs

### PoC

imagine a scenario total amount user can claim 200
for first 
claimableAmount = 200 * (1/6)
claimableAmount = 200 * 0.1667
claimableAmount = 33.33


Month 1: 33.33
Month 2: 66.67
Month 3: 100.00
Month 4: 133.33
Month 5: 166.67
Month 6: 200.00
Total Claimed by non tax payers: 700.00

meanwhile someone who paid tax will only receive 200 mind you this is without considering any penalty or tax



### Mitigation

mitigation depends on how the total amount is calculated which is passed in available to calculate the amount
