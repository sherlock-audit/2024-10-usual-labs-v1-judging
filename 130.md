### Attack Path

The following formula taken from the [`AirdropTaxCollector._calculateClaimTaxAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.sol#L217) function in Lines 232-233 below is used to compute the tax amount for the given account.

```solidity
taxFee = $.maxChargeableTax.mulDiv(claimingTimeLeft, AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH);
claimTaxAmount = claimerUsd0PPBalance.mulDiv(taxFee, BASIS_POINT_BASE);
```

```solidity
File: AirdropTaxCollector.sol
217:     function _calculateClaimTaxAmount(AirdropTaxCollectorStorage storage $, address account)
218:         internal
219:         view
220:         returns (uint256 claimTaxAmount)
221:     {
222:         uint256 claimerUsd0PPBalance = $.prelaunchUsd0ppBalance[account];
223: 
224:         uint256 claimingTimeLeft;
225:         if (block.timestamp > AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME + AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH) {
226:             claimingTimeLeft = 0;
227:         } else {
228:             claimingTimeLeft =
229:                 AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME + AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH - block.timestamp;
230:         }
231: 
232:         uint256 taxFee = $.maxChargeableTax.mulDiv(claimingTimeLeft, AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH);
233:         claimTaxAmount = claimerUsd0PPBalance.mulDiv(taxFee, BASIS_POINT_BASE);
234:     }
```

The `AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH` above is hardcoded to `182 days`, which is `15724800`, in the codebase.

Assume that the `maxChargeableTax` is set to `1000` (10%)(which is a reasonable value as it is used in the [test script](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/test/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.t.sol#L507)).

The issue is that it is possible for a rounding to zero error to occur in the following formula used in the codebase:

```solidity
taxFee = $.maxChargeableTax.mulDiv(claimingTimeLeft, AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH)
taxFee = 1000.mulDiv(claimingTimeLeft, 15724800)
```

Next, we determine what range of `claimingTimeLeft` will lead to a rounding to zero error to occur via the following method.

The inequality is:

$$
\text{claimingTimeLeft} < \frac{\text{AIRDROP\\_CLAIMING\\_PERIOD\\_LENGTH}}{\text{maxChargeableTax}}
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
\text{claimingTimeLeft} < \frac{15724800}{1000} = 15724.8
$$

As shown above, if the `claimingTimeLeft` is less than 15724, the `taxFee` will round down to zero. Therefore, any value of `claimingTimeLeft` from 0 up to 15723 will yield `taxFee = 0`.

As a result, calling the `payTaxAmount` function in the last 262.05 min or 4.3675 hours is technically free, which means that users can immediately unlock all their airdrops bypassing the vesting period without paying any tax to the protocol.

The issue is aggravated if the `maxChargeableTax` is set to a lower value, such as 100 (1%)(also a reasonable value as it is used in the [test script](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/test/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.t.sol#L161)). In this case, calling the `payTaxAmount` function in the last 43.68 hours or 1.82 day is technically free.

$$
\text{claimingTimeLeft} < \frac{15724800}{100} = 157248
$$

### Impact

Loss of assets for the protocol as users can bypass paying tax to unlock all their airdrops.

Severity: High. Loss of assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Increasing the `maxChargeableTax` precision will mitigate the issue.

Currently, the precision of `maxChargeableTax` is 1e4 (10000). Let's increase the precision to from 1e4 to 1e8 instead to verify if increasing the precision will mitigate the issue.

In this case, if `maxChargeableTax` is 1%, the value will be `1000000` under 1e8 precision.

$$
\text{claimingTimeLeft} < \frac{15724800}{1000000} = 15
$$

The above shows that only the last 14 seconds will result in rounding to zero error, which is a huge improvement.
