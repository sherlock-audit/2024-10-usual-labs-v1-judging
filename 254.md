# the remaining rwa to return to user is calculated incorrectly

### Summary

when swapperengine is called to swap rwa the function mints equivalent amount of usd0 and sends the amount to swapperengine to handle the swap. the amount that didnt get matched is stored as wadRwaNotTakenInUSD if the amount is more than 0 the function calls _getQuoteInToken to calculate the amount to return to the user the amount is stored as rwatokenstoreturn 

            uint256 rwaTokensToReturn = _getQuoteInToken(wadRwaNotTakenInUSD, rwaToken);

however when _getQuoteInToken is called 

     function _getQuoteInToken(uint256 wadStableAmount, address rwaToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 amountInToken)
    {
        (uint256 wadPriceInUSD, uint8 decimals) = _getPriceAndDecimals(rwaToken);
        // will result in an amount with the same 'decimals' as the token
        amountInToken = wadStableAmount.wadTokenAmountForPrice(wadPriceInUSD, decimals);
    }

this function returns the price of the token which is then storedrwaTokensToReturn  in and not the actual amount that should be transferred to user it doesnt convert the amount contract will not be able to convert the stablecoin amount into the corresponding amount of the rwaToken as a result the user wont receive the actual amount of tokens
