# Using the treasury oracle price at 100% of its value to mint usd0 can allow minter to mint more stablecoin than what is actually backed

### Summary

The issue is quite similar to this one:  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD-judging/issues/836
Allowing the users to mint usd0 using the treasury assets, at 100% of its value based on the oracle price without a fee or a safer check can affect the usd0 price if its totalSupply is much greater than the its backing.
The Oracle price can not be trusted as the real-time price.
Price feeds on miannet have a "Deviation threshold" of 0.5%, meaning that the price will only be updated once the price movement exceeds 0.5% within the heartbeat period. The max number of rwa assets that back usd0 is 10, if all of them have oracle prices that are up by 0.5% of their actual price it's a big issue as minter will be able to mint more than he should. Say if the previous price point for a rwa asset is 1000 USD, the price will only be updated once the price goes up to more than 1005 USD or down to less than 995 USD.

### Root Cause

This check is not safe enough:

### Impact

Unhealthy minting of usd0 that could cause an unpeg as it the quality of the treasury's rwa continuously decreases

### Mitigation

Protocol can consider adding a minting fee of 0.5% to 1% (should be higher than the deviation) or make the following changes:
```diff
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        //...
-       if (totalSupply() + amount > wadRwaBackingInUSD) {
+       if (totalSupply() + amount > wadRwaBackingInUSD - wadRwaBackingInUSD/200) {
            revert AmountExceedBacking();
        }
        //...
    }
```
