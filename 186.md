# Proof Reuse Enabling Front-Running of Penalty Reductions Operations

### Summary

The reusability of merkle proofs across vesting periods enables systematic front-running of penalty reductions, causing permanent economic loss for airdrop recipients as attackers can repeatedly force claims during high penalty periods using the same proof, preventing users from benefiting from both time-weighted averaging and explicit penalty reductions.


### Root Cause

1. The choice to allow proof reuse across periods by excluding timestamp/period/ nonce from merkle leaf generation at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L328
```solidity
bytes32 leaf = keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(account, totalAmount, isTop80))));
```

2. The ability to reduce penalties is built into the system:

```solidity
// Explicit penalty reduction through admin function
function setPenaltyPercentages(
    uint256[] memory penaltyPercentages,
    address[] memory accounts,
    uint256 month
) external {
    // Allows reduction of penalties
    if (penaltyPercentages[i] > BASIS_POINT_BASE) {
        revert AmountTooBig();
    }
    $.penaltyPercentageByMonth[accounts[i]][month] = penaltyPercentages[i];
}

// Time-weighted penalty reductions possible through holding requirements
// Example: If user rebuys NFTs, their penalty for current month could be reduced
// due to time-weighted average of holdings
```

Penalty Reductions Are Possible & Expected

1. **Code-Level Possibility:**
```solidity
// setPenaltyPercentages allows reduction
function setPenaltyPercentages(
    uint256[] memory penaltyPercentages,
    address[] memory accounts,
    uint256 month
) external {
    // Can set lower penalties
    // No minimum penalty enforced
    $.penaltyPercentageByMonth[accounts[i]][month] = penaltyPercentages[i];
}
```

2. **Time-Weighted Nature:**
```solidity
// Example penalty calculation
function computeMonthPenalty(address user, uint256 month) internal {
    // If user holds required NFTs for part of month:
    // penalty = (daysWithoutNFTs * highPenalty + daysWithNFTs * lowPenalty) / totalDays
    // This creates natural penalty reduction opportunities
}
```

3. **Business Logic for Reductions:**
   - Users may temporarily lose qualification (NFT transfers, etc.)
   - Technical issues might cause temporary non-compliance
   - Market conditions might require temporary position adjustments
   - Protocol might want to adjust penalties based on market feedback

### Attack Path

1. Attacker obtains proof from month 1 claim event or merkle tree data:
```solidity
event Claimed(address indexed account, uint256 indexed amount);
// Proof can be extracted from successful claim transaction
```

2. For each vesting period:
   - Monitor penalty situations for target accounts
   - When penalty reduction is likely (either through time-weighted averaging or admin action)
   - Front-run using stored proof:
```solidity
// Can be executed each month with same proof
claim(victimAddress, true, amount, storedProof); 
```

### Impact

User will suffer loss of fund due to excess penalty even if they take rectifying steps.
