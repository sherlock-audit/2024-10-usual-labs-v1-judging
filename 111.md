# Airdrop Penalty Evasion In case of Post-Period Penalty Setting with Final Period Immunity

### Summary

The misalignment between penalty setting and claiming periods will cause a penalty avoidance vulnerability for the protocol as users can front-run penalty assignments by claiming tokens immediately when vesting periods unlock, with month 6 being completely immune to penalties.


### Root Cause

The choice to allow users to claim immediately when a period unlocks while requiring month >= monthsPassed for penalty setting creates a fundamental timing advantage for users to claim before penalties can be enforced. While penalties can be set for any period including month 6, when protocol tries to set penalties for the month that has just passed,  users can always claim before such penalties are set, making the penalty mechanism ineffective. It is likely that some penalties can only be determined completely after the month has fully passed as they are time-weighted.

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L371
```solidity
// Users can claim as soon as a month passes
if (isTop80 && !hasPaidTax) {
    if (monthsPassed == 0) {
        revert NotClaimableYet();
    }
    claimableAmount = totalAmount.mulDiv(monthsPassed, AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS);
}

// But penalties can be set after month has passed for the just passed month
function setPenaltyPercentages(...) {
    uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();
    // month must be >= monthsPassed
    if (month < monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) {
        revert OutOfBounds();
    }
}
```



### Internal pre-conditions
User is Top 80% and  has not paid tax OR
User is Top 80%  and has paid tax and can avoid the future (running month penalty which protocol intends to impose by passing monthsPassed + 1 to penalty calculations)

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

For months 1-5:

- Month N ends
- Month N+1 starts
- User immediately claims tokens before admin sets penalties for N
- User gets early access to tokens with penalty applied next month

For month 6:

- Month 6 unlocks
- User claims month 6 tokens
- No month 6 penalty can be enforced plied after month 6 months have passed even if admin sets it as user has already claimed full amount

### Impact

The protocol suffers loss of penalty enforcement capability with an especially severe impact on the final month where penalties are completely impossible to enforce. The economic impact includes:

- Month 6 penalties cannot be enforced
- For other months early claiming without penalties is particularly advantageous as token value is likely to decrease when more supply unlocks through vesting periods
