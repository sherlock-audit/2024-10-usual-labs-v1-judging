### Attack Path

The [`queueOffChainUsualDistribution`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L688) function/transaction lacks the expiry mechanism.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L688

```solidity
File: DistributionModule.sol
678:     /// @inheritdoc IDistributionOperator
679:     function queueOffChainUsualDistribution(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external whenNotPaused {
680:         DistributionModuleStorageV0 storage $ = _distributionModuleStorageV0();
681:         _requireOnlyOperator($);
682: 
683:         if (_merkleRoot == bytes32(0)) {
684:             revert NullMerkleRoot();
685:         }
686: 
687:         $.offChainDistributionQueue.push(
688:             QueuedOffChainDistribution({timestamp: block.timestamp, merkleRoot: _merkleRoot})
689:         );
690:         emit OffChainDistributionQueued(block.timestamp, _merkleRoot);
691:     }
```

Assume the following scenario:

- At T0, $Operator_A$ submits a QueuedOffChainDistribution with Merkle root A. Call this Transaction A (TX A)

- At T1, $Operator_B$ submits a QueuedOffChainDistribution with Merkle root B (which is the final and last Merkle root posted). Call this Transaction B (TX B)

One would expect the final on-chain Merkle root to be $B$ since it is the latest or "last-sent" transaction that the operator submitted. 

However, transactions executed on Ethereum do not operate on a first-come, first-served basis; the miner determines the execution of the transaction when building the block. 

Assume that TX B is executed first and the on-chain Merkle Root has been updated to $B$.

At this point, TX A has not been executed yet, and is still pending in the mempool for a period of time. TX A will remain valid for a period of time as it does not have an expiry mechanism.

At some point later, TX A gets picked up by a miner and gets executed. The on-chain Merkle Root will be updated to $A$ since it has the latest `block.timestamp`.

As a result, the existing on-chain Merkle Root $B$ get overwritten by the outdated and incorrect Merkle Root $A$.

### Impact

Off-chain distribution of the Usual token will be incorrect in an edge case, leading to a loss of funds for the affected users.

Severity: Medium. Loss of assets under certain external conditions or specific states.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing an expiry mechanism so that `queueOffChainUsualDistribution` transactions that exceed the predefined duration will be rejected.
