# PARMechanism can be frontrunned by arbitrage bots when usd0++ price is less than floorPrice

### Summary

When the price of Usd0++ drops/depegs, the protocol triggers the PARMechanism to maintain the peg between usd0++ and usd0 via a curve pool exchange of usd0 for usd0++.
The issue is that this transaction can be frontrun and when the price drop is below the usd0++ floor price there's enough incentive to do so


### Root Cause

In Usd0PP the [`triggerPARMechanismCurvepool`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0PP.sol#L342-L395) function is called when there's a depeg in the usd0++ price. The usd0++ price is restored by performing a usd0 - usd0++ swap in the usd0/usd0++ curve pool, burning the usd0++ and transferring any excess usd0 to the treasury.
The issue is that this process can be done by anyone by performing the exchange on the curve pool directly and using the `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice` function they can instantly unwrap the usd0++ to receive usd0 at the usd0++ floor price.
When the price of usd0++ in the pool is below the usd0++ floor price, this action is highly profitable and the protocols treasury will gain less tokens than it would have if the `triggerPARMechanismCurvepool` function was called.

### Internal pre-conditions

usd0++ price is less than floorPrice

### External pre-conditions

Arbitrage bots or mempool watchers frontrunning the transaction


### Attack Path

Medium - constant frontrunning of the PARMechanism will have an impact on the protocol generated revenue
