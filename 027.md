# Stakers in UsualSP may get less rewards that expected.

### Summary

Actual total stake amount in [UsualSP.sol:449](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L449) may be less than the return value in totalStaked(). This will lead that `rewardPerToken` is less than expected. The stakers may get less rewards than expected.

### Root Cause

In [RewardAccrualBase.sol:124](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/modules/RewardAccrualBase.sol#L124), we will update the latest `rewardPerToken` according to the current rewards. The problem is that `totalStaked()` may be larger than actual staked amount. This will cause the calculated `rewardPerToken` will be less than the expected rewards.
The `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` will transfer all UsualS tokens(360_000_000e18) into this contract via `stakeUsualS`. If the `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` allocates Alice 1e18 original allocations. Now only these 1e18 allocations should be taken into account in the actual stake.

```solidity
    function _rewardPerToken() internal view virtual returns (uint256 rewardPerToken) {
        ...
        if (totalStaked() == 0) {
            return $.rewardPerTokenStored;
        } else {
            ...
            uint256 rewardIncrease = $.rewardRate * timeElapsed;
            rewardPerToken = $.rewardPerTokenStored
                + rewardIncrease.mulDiv(1e24, totalStaked(), Math.Rounding.Floor); // 1e6 for precision loss
        }
    }
    function totalStaked() public view override returns (uint256) {
        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        return $.usualS.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
```
In readme, sponsors mentions that `An applicable scenario would be if nobody is staking in UsualX or UsualSP, therefore any rewards accrued would be essentially unredeemable. `. This case is one different case, because we have some actual stakers, but these stakers will lose some expected rewards.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` transfer all UsualS token into UsualSP via `stakeUsualS()`.
2. `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` allocates 1e18 original allocations to Alice.
3. Start the first distribution. Now Alice can not get all rewards.

### Impact

Stakers will lose some expected rewards.

### Mitigation

We should add one internal account to calculate the actual stake amount.
