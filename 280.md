# no storage gaps present in upgradable conteact.

### Summary

For upgradable contracts its recommended that storage gaps are induced to allow for developers to freely add new state variables in the next iteration of contracts without disrupting the storage compatibility with existing deployed contracts.

### Root Cause

contract DaoCollateral is
    IDaoCollateral,
    Initializable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    NoncesUpgradeable,
    EIP712Upgradeable
{

contract AirdropDistribution is
    Initializable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    IAirdropDistribution
{

contract AirdropTaxCollector is
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    IAirdropTaxCollector
{
