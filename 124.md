# Incorrect calculation of fee in `UsualX::withdraw()` leading to protocol taking less fee amount and other consequences.

### Summary

`UsualX::withdraw()` calculates the `fee` from the withdrawal incorrectly less than what it should, resulting to more shares burned and the protocol taking less fee than expected.

### Root Cause

In `UsualX::withdraw()` user specify the `assets` that he wants to **receive** after the withdrawal fee been taken into consideration. This means that he specifies the final amount that he wants to get into his wallet. However, there is a withdrawal fee on `UsualX` vault and, for this reason, the shares that he will have to burn will not be the direct conversion of the assets that he will get on his pocket. Let's see `UsualX::previewWithdraw()` to understand this :
```solidity
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares) {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        // Calculate the fee based on the equivalent assets of these shares
@>        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
            assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil
        );
        // Calculate total assets needed, including fee
@>        uint256 assetsWithFee = assets + fee;

        // Convert the total assets (including fee) to shares
@>        shares = _convertToShares(assetsWithFee, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    }
```

The crucial variable for this calculation is the `assetsWithFee` one. This variables represents the direct conversion with shares and this is the total amount that must be "withdrawn" and subtracted from the `totalDeposits` since its equivalent `shares` have been burned. A part of `assetsWithFee` will go to user (`asset` amount as specified ) and the rest part of `assetsWithFee` will stay on protocol (`fee` amount). So far, so good. Let's see what the `UsualX::withdraw()` does, so to understand the problem now :
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
        public
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        YieldDataStorage storage yieldStorage = _getYieldDataStorage();

        // Check withdrawal limit
        uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
        }
        // Calculate shares needed
@>        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
@>        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

        // Perform withdrawal (exact assets to receiver)
        super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);

        // take the fee
@>        yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
    }
```

The `shares` are calculated correctly as we saw in `UsualX::previewWithdraw()`, however `fee` is not. Instead of the `fee` to be calculated out of the `assetsWithFee` amount as in `previewWithdraw` and take a percentage of it, it is calculated as a percentage of `assets` amount which is the final amount that will end up to user's wallet. In this way, in this way `assets + fee` are not equal conversion to the shares burned as it were in the `previewWithdraw()` function.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. A withdrawal fee to be set.

### External pre-conditions

1. A user wants to withdraw calling `UsualX::withdraw()` function.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits through `deposit`.
2. User withdraw after some time calling `withdraw()` and specifying the final amount that he wants to get into his wallet.

### Impact

Impact : High - The protocol takes less fees than expected with the result of more shares burned for this withdrawal inflating the value of the rest shares.
Likelihood : High - It will happen **every** time someone calls `withdraw()` on `UsualX` vault specifying the final asset amount that he wants to get out.

The impact of this vulnerability is that the value of the rest shares of the depositors will be inflated since less amount will be subtracted out of `totalDeposits` than it should be. Also, the protocol is taking less fee than what should take and also the user is underpaying for it. As a result, the withdrawal fee is completely broken for every withdrawal is happening through `UsualX::withdraw()`.
