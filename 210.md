# Privileged roles cannot burn tokens of the blacklisted users.

### Summary

Due to the check in the ```_update``` function that prevents any action when the ```from``` address is blacklisted, privileged roles of the Usd0.sol, Usd0PP.sol, Usual.sol, UsualS.sol contracts cannot burn tokens of the blacklisted users.

### Root Cause

The ```_update``` function has the following check and it will reverts if is true:
```solidity
 if ($.isBlacklisted[from] || $.isBlacklisted[to]) {
            revert Blacklisted();
        }
```
```_update``` is called within the ERC20 implementation in every interaction which also includes the function ```_burn```. 

Therefore, burning of the tokens from the blacklisted users by the designated burner role will revert.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Blacklisted tokens stuck in an address inflate the total supply, creating a misalignment with asset backing, reducing liquidity, potentially diluting rewards for other users, and skewing governance decisions by misrepresenting the effective circulating supply.








### PoC

### Mitigation

Burn the tokens of the address during the blacklist process(will need to mint tokens if unblacklisted) or modify ```_update``` function to make an exception for the blacklisted address in case the ```to``` address is address(0).
