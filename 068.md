# An usualS blacklisted address cannot claim their `originalAllocation` balance, but still can enjoy the rewards harvesting from it

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

In UsualSP.sol, a user typically earn Usual reward tokens through two primary methods, 
1. via holding onto their `usualS` originalAllocation(by not claiming)
2. or via staking `usualS` tokens

If users are currently in state (1) and get blacklisted by the `UsualS` token (possibly due to engaging in illicit activities), any transactions involving the transfer of `UsualS` tokens "to" or "from" their address are likely to fail, as shown below

The problem is that even after being blacklisted, such accounts can still harvest their `Usual` token rewards by calling the `claimReward()` function. This is due to fact the unclaimed `originalAllocation` counted towards the user shares balance, which is directly used to calculate the accrued rewards. 

```solidity
    function balanceOf(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        return
            $.liquidAllocation[account] + $.originalAllocation[account] - $.originalClaimed[account];   // @audit
    }
```
```solidity
    function _earned(address account) internal view virtual returns (uint256 earned) {
        RewardAccrualBaseStorageV0 storage $ = _getRewardAccrualBaseDataStorage();
        uint256 accountBalance = balanceOf(account); // @audit 
        uint256 rewardDelta = $.rewardPerTokenStored - $.lastRewardPerTokenUsed[account];
        earned = accountBalance.mulDiv(rewardDelta, 1e24, Math.Rounding.Floor) + $.rewards[account]; // 1e24 for precision loss
    }
```
### Impact

The blacklisted address by usualS contract are indirectly utilizing usualS balance(because its unclaimed yet) to earn usual token rewards.

### Mitigation

```diff

    function claimReward() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        
+       if ($.usualS.isBlacklisted(msg.sender) revert Blacklisted(); 
        if (block.timestamp < $.startDate + ONE_MONTH) {
            revert NotClaimableYet();
        }

        return _claimRewards();
    }

```
