# Missing ERC20 Approval for Token Transfer leading dos

### Summary

The AirdropTaxCollector contract contains a critical vulnerability in its _payTaxAmount function. The function attempts to transfer USD0PP tokens from users to the treasury using safeTransferFrom, but it lacks the necessary ERC20 approval to do so. This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, preventing users from paying their airdrop tax and claiming their rewards.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.sol#L241C1-L277C6

1. The Vulnerable Code:

The vulnerability lies in the following line of code within the _payTaxAmount function:
```solidity 
$.usd0PP.safeTransferFrom(account, $.treasury, claimTaxAmount);
```
This line attempts to transfer claimTaxAmount of USD0PP tokens from the user's account (account) to the treasury ($.treasury) using the safeTransferFrom function of the IUsd0PP contract.

2. The safeTransferFrom Function:

The safeTransferFrom function is a standard function in the ERC20 token interface. It allows a third party (the caller) to transfer tokens from one address to another on behalf of the token owner. However, it has a crucial requirement: the caller must have been pre-approved by the token owner to spend the specified amount of tokens.

3. Missing Approval:

The AirdropTaxCollector contract does not have any mechanism to obtain this approval from users. There is no code in the contract where users grant the AirdropTaxCollector an allowance to transfer their USD0PP tokens.

4. The Inevitable Revert:

As a result of the missing approval, the safeTransferFrom call will always revert. When a user calls payTaxAmount to pay their airdrop tax, the transaction will fail at this line, preventing the tax payment from being processed.

### Attack Path

Phase 1: Setup

Airdrop Initialization: The airdrop program is initialized, and the AirdropTaxCollector contract is deployed. The AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME and AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH are set, defining the period during which users can claim their airdrop rewards.

Pre-launch USD0PP Balances: Users hold USD0PP tokens before the official launch of the airdrop. These balances are recorded in the prelaunchUsd0ppBalance mapping in the AirdropTaxCollector contract.

Airdrop Claiming Period Begins: The airdrop claiming period starts, allowing users to claim their rewards by paying a calculated tax.

Phase 2: The Attack

Attacker Attempts Tax Payment: A malicious actor (the attacker), who holds a pre-launch balance of USD0PP, calls the payTaxAmount function on the AirdropTaxCollector contract.

Tax Calculation: The contract calculates the claimTaxAmount based on the attacker's pre-launch USD0PP balance and the time remaining in the claiming period.

safeTransferFrom Execution and Revert: The execution reaches the vulnerable line: $.usd0PP.safeTransferFrom(account, $.treasury, claimTaxAmount);. This line attempts to transfer the calculated tax amount from the attacker's account to the treasury. However, since the AirdropTaxCollector contract does not have the necessary approval to transfer the attacker's USD0PP tokens, the safeTransferFrom function reverts.

Denial of Service (DoS): The transaction reverts, preventing the attacker from paying their tax. More importantly, this revert affects all other users attempting to pay their airdrop tax. The payTaxAmount function will consistently fail for everyone due to the missing approval.



### Impact

1. Airdrop Claiming Disruption:

This bug completely disrupts the intended functionality of the airdrop. Users cannot claim their rewards, leading to frustration and a potential loss of trust in the system.

2. Potential for Funds to be Locked:

If the airdrop claiming period ends and users haven't been able to pay their tax, their USD0PP tokens might become effectively locked. They might not be able to participate in early unlocks or other functionalities that require tax payment.



### PoC

### Mitigation

transfer Called by Token Owner: The transfer function is meant to be called by the token owner themselves. In this context, the user calling payTaxAmount is the owner of the USD0PP tokens they are using to pay the tax.
No Approval Required: The transfer function does not require any pre-approval. The token owner can directly transfer their tokens to the specified recipient ($.treasury in this case).
