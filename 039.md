# tokens will be stuck in the ``DistributionModule and AirdropDistribution `` contract if  ``  claimedUpToNow > amount.`` `` claimableAmount <= totalClaimed``

### Summary
In `DistributionModule.sol`, eligble user can claim their total allocated tokens in merkle tree through ``claimOffChainDistribution`` . If ``claimedUpToNow is >= amount`` which will cause user tokens to be stuck.

same issue in AirdropDistribution.
`AirdropDistribution`,
### Root Cause

In `DistributionModule:L409-L410`, if the claimedUpToNow is greater than amount then it will revert.
In `AirdropDistribution:L260-L262`, if the total claimed is greater than claimableamount then it will revert.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User calls ``claimOffChainDistribution`` to claim tokens. Assuming the total tokens = 100 tokens for user.
2. Attacker see the transaction and front runs User using its parameter but only changing its amount to 60 tokens or ``User claim only 60 % of the tokens.``
3. User transaction will revert due ``60 > 100 `` to claiming more than allocated  and receive the 60 tokens .
4. User see that he only received only 60 tokens out of 100 tokens .User now tries to claim its 40 tokens but the transaction will revert .

### Impact

loss of tokens for users.

### PoC
Consider , the total amount of user can claim is 100 tokens .
if the user claims up to 60 then then left is 40:
```solidity
claimedUpToNow = 60
amount = left = 100 - 60 = 40 
60 >= 40 : will revert here

```

```solidity
        if (claimableAmount <= totalClaimed) {
            revert NothingToClaim();
        }
```
[DistributionModule](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L409-L410)
```solidity
        if (claimedUpToNow >= amount) {
            revert NoTokensToClaim();
        }
```

### Mitigation

for distribution module :change logic to claim all token at once.
for airdrop distrbution : i am not sure about this.
