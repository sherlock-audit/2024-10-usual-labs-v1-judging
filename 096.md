# In Airdrop, users who do not claim immediately after payTax will pay the excess penalty amount.

### Summary

In Airdrop, users who do not claim immediately after `payTax` will pay the excess penalty amount.

### Root Cause

Both `payTaxAmount` and `_computePenalty` are calculated according to the current time, so as to avoid double payment (Tax and Penalty).

However, there is a case where the user `payTaxAmount` does not execute the `claim` immediately, but executes it one or more months later, so that the user with `monthsPassed > 0` will double pay the tax and Penalty.

It's possible, and it's not the user's fault, the user has the right to decide when to claim the token(within the validity period).

```solidity
    function _computePenalty(
        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $,
        uint256 totalAmount,
        address account,
        uint256 monthsPassed
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        uint256 penaltyAmount = 0;
        uint256 oneSixthAmount = totalAmount.mulDiv(1, AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS, Math.Rounding.Ceil);    
        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= monthsPassed; i++) {
            if ($.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i] == 0) {
                continue;
            } else if ($.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i] == BASIS_POINT_BASE) { //BASIS_POINT_BASE = 10_000;
                penaltyAmount += oneSixthAmount;
            } else {
                uint256 monthlyPenalty = oneSixthAmount.mulDiv($.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i], BASIS_POINT_BASE);
                penaltyAmount += monthlyPenalty;
            }
            $.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i] = 0;
        }
        return penaltyAmount;
    }

    function _payTaxAmount(address account) internal {
        AirdropTaxCollectorStorage storage $ = _airdropTaxCollectorStorage();

        bool isBeforeStartDate = block.timestamp < AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME;
        bool isAfterEndDate = block.timestamp > AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME + AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH;

        if (isBeforeStartDate || isAfterEndDate) {
            revert NotInClaimingPeriod();
        }

        if ($.taxedClaimers[account]) {
            revert ClaimerHasPaidTax();
        }

        // Check if the account hasn't voided it's eligibility for airdrop
        IAirdropDistribution airdropContract = IAirdropDistribution($.registryContract.getContract(CONTRACT_AIRDROP_DISTRIBUTION));
        if (airdropContract.getRagequitStatus(account)) {
            revert AirdropVoided();
        }

        uint256 claimTaxAmount = _calculateClaimTaxAmount($, account);

        $.taxedClaimers[account] = true;
        $.usd0PP.setBondEarlyUnlockDisabled(account);
        emit AirdropTaxPaid(account, claimTaxAmount);

        $.usd0PP.safeTransferFrom(account, $.treasury, claimTaxAmount);
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The user pays tax on month 0.
2. The user does not claim the token at month 0, but calls the claim 6 months later.
3. The user has paid the excess penalty amount.
4. This is not the user's fault, the user has the right to decide when to claim the token(within the validity period)

### Impact

Loss of user funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Calculate the amount of the penalty based on the time of payTax instead of the current time.
