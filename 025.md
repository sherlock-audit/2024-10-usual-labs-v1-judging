# The use of exact assets for fee calculation in UsualX::withdraw inflates totalAssets(), enabling users to extract excess assets (or have less shares burnt) and possibly leading to under-collected fees for the protocol

### Summary

The incorrect calculation of fees based on deflated (exact) assets in `withdraw()` causes an under-collection of fees for the protocol (if the existing bug that's been reported separately were to be fixed with the fee sent to the treasury or fee collector on the fly), which artificially inflates `totalAssets()`. This inflation in turn allows users to extract more assets than intended when subsequently redeeming (or less shares burnt when subsequently withdrawing), leading to an exploitable imbalance in the protocol's asset pool.

### Root Cause

In UsualX.sol:336, the `withdraw()` function calculates the withdrawal fee using the exact (a deflated) assets amount,

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L336

```solidity
        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
```
instead of the intended share equivalent (`assetWithFee`). 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L395-L400

```solidity
        // Calculate the fee based on the equivalent assets of these shares
        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
            assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil
        );
        // Calculate total assets needed, including fee
        uint256 assetsWithFee = assets + fee;
```
As a result, [`yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L341-L342) under-represents the fee impact, causing [`totalAssets()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/YieldBearingVault.sol#L66-L74) to be higher than it should be. 

```solidity
    function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
        YieldDataStorage storage $ = _getYieldDataStorage();
        uint256 currentAssets = $.totalDeposits + _calculateEarnedYield();
        return currentAssets;
    }
```
This inflated `totalAssets()` value leads to overestimated asset calculations in [`previewRedeem()` and `convertToAssets()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L435) or underestimated share calculations in [previewWithdraw()` and `_convertToShares()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L403).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user must call `withdraw()` on `UsualX`.
2. The `assets` parameter passed to `withdraw()` is already adjusted to an inflated value by `previewWithdraw` to convert the total assets (including fee) to shares.
3. The `fee` is calculated using the deflated assets, leading to a smaller-than-expected decrement in `yieldStorage.totalDeposits`.

### External pre-conditions

1. The protocol has had users staking in `UsualX`, allowing users to withdraw funds.
2. Stakers seeing this flaw choose to unstake via `withdraw()` instead of `redeem()`, as doing this will let them withdraw more assets than expected (even after fee adjustment) when making future calls on `redeem()` or burn less shares than expected when making future calls on `withdraw()`.

### Attack Path

1. The user calls `withdraw`.
2. `previewWithdraw` is triggered on an exact assets withdrawal amount, inflating the assets value to account for a fee, such that $0.75 worth of assets are withdrawn for every $1 in shares burned, presuming a 25% fee.
3. The fee is calculated based on the deflated assets, resulting in a fee that is proportionally smaller than intended ($0.1875 instead of $0.25 for every dollar worth of assets).
4. The user still pays for the correct fee. It's just that `yieldStorage.totalDeposits` won't be updated correctly. It will deduct lesser amount of fee.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L341-L342

```solidity
        // take the fee
        yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
```
5. Over time, this pattern leads to cumulative under-collection of fees relative to the protocolâ€™s intended `withdrawFeeBps` percentage (also a bug that I have reported with a different report).
6. When another user calls `redeem()`, the inflated `totalAssets()` value results in a higher asset amount being calculated by `previewRedeem()` and `convertToAssets()`.

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L232-L234

```solidity
    function _convertToAssets(uint256 shares, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256) {
        return shares.mulDiv(totalAssets() + 1, totalSupply() + 10 ** _decimalsOffset(), rounding);
    }
```
7. After subtracting the withdrawal fee, the user receives more assets than they would have with accurate `totalAssets()` calculations, draining excess value from the protocol.

Note: Subsequent calls on `withdraw()` will also have the users experience similar gain because the inflated `totalAssets()` again incurs less shares burnt than they should via `previewWithdraw` and `_convertToShares`, on top of repeating the exploit steps 1-5.

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L225-L227

```solidity
    function _convertToShares(uint256 assets, Math.Rounding rounding) internal view virtual returns (uint256) {
        return assets.mulDiv(totalSupply() + 10 ** _decimalsOffset(), totalAssets() + 1, rounding);
    }
```
### Impact

Users redeem more assets (or withdraw assets with less shares burnt) than intended due to inflated `totalAssets()` at the expense of the protocol fee entitlement. Over time, this discrepancy may lead to substantial asset imbalances, allowing savvy users to extract excess value and potentially jeopardizing protocol intended design.

### Mitigation

The following code refactoring should have the issues resolved:

        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        // Calculate the fee based on the equivalent assets of these shares
        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
            assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil
        );
        // Calculate total assets needed, including fee
        uint256 assetsWithFee = assets + fee;

        // Convert the total assets (including fee) to shares
        shares = _convertToShares(assetsWithFee, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    }
