# Missing state variable for tracking accrued withdrawal fees in UsualX contract

### Summary

The `UsualX` contract can't track accrued withdrawal fees as it lacks a state variable to store this information.

### Root Cause

The [UsualX](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L50) contract is missing a state variable to record accrued withdrawal fees.

### Internal pre-conditions

- No internal pre-conditions are required.

### External pre-conditions

- No external pre-conditions are required.

### Impact

The protocol can't accurately manage accrued withdrawal fees, especially during future contract upgrades.

### Mitigation

Add a state variable in the `UsualX` contract to store accrued withdrawal fee information.
