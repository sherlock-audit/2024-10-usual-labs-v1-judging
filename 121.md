# Time-Weighted Penalty Implementation Issue in Airdrop Distribution for Tax paid users

### Summary

The design choice to apply penalties for current month during tax payment will cause an unfair penalty application for users or protocol.


### Root Cause

The choice to include current month's penalty (monthsPassed + 1) during tax payment is a problematic as it creates an unsolvable timing conflict between fair time-weighted penalty calculation and tax payment mechanics

In `AirdropDistribution.sol` at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L249, the critical issue appears in:
```solidity
penaltyAmount = _computePenalty(
    $, totalAmount, account, hasPaidTax ? monthsPassed + 1 : monthsPassed
);
```

### Attack Path

Taking example of user with 10 NFTs in Month 3:

1. User waits until middle of Month 3 (Day 15)
2. User burns all 10 NFTs
3. Protocol faces three sub-optimal choices:
   a. Immediately set 50% penalty ( time-weighted penalty for the entire month)
      - User pays tax on Day 20, locks in 50% penalty which is higher than what is fair
      
   b. Don't set penalty and wait until month end to set accurate penalty
      - User pays tax on Day 20, completely avoids penalty
      
   c. Regularly update penalty with correct upto date time-weighted penalty
      - There will still be unfairness based on frequency of updates
      - Significant cost for protocol considering number of users, and period. Has to be done for all future months.

### Impact


**The protocol and users face systematic fairness and operational issues:**

1. With immediate 50% penalty setting:
   - Users who pay tax mid-month are penalized unfairly higher
   - For the example user, they'd pay 50% penalty when they should only pay ~25% (15 days of full holdings out of 20 days elapsed in month)

2. With delayed penalty setting:
   - Users completely avoid deserved penalties by paying tax before month end
   - In example, user avoids ~25% justified penalty by paying tax on Day 20
   - Protocol loses legitimate penalty revenue

3. With regular updates:
   - Protocol faces significant operational costs updating penalties frequently
   - Example: For 1000 users over 6 month period, with weekly updates = 24,000 penalty updates
   - Gas costs and operational overhead become prohibitive
   - Even with updates, still discrepancies and unfairness exists.
   
The fundamental issue creates a trilemma where protocol must choose between:
- Unfairly high penalties for users (Option A)
- Loss of legitimate penalty revenue (Option B)
- Unsustainable operational costs (Option C)

No solution provides both fair penalty application and practical operational implementation.
