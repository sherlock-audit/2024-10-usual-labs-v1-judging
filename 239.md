# Absence of code to set the value for bond start time renders the contracts useless.

### Summary

Usd0pp contract is avaialble to users to create bonds only after block.timestamp >= $.bondStart.[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0PP.sol#L82)

But as of now, `$.bondStart` is not intialised anywhere in the contract nor it can be set by anyone. 

This renders the contract  useless.

>Breaks core contract functionality, rendering the contract useless or leading to loss of funds of the affected party larger than 0.01% and 10 USD

Hence I believe this should be considerd as a medium severity.
