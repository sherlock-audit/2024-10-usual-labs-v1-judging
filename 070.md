# Incorrect Withdrawal Fee Calculation Leading to Overburn of Shares

### Summary

The withdraw function in the usualX contract incorrectly calculates the withdrawal fee, resulting in an overburn of user shares. Specifically, a 10% withdrawal fee causes more than 10% of shares to be burned, leading to an effective fee above the intended rate. Additionally, while 11% of shares may be burned, only 10% of the asset value is deducted from the totalDeposit. This discrepancy can lead to an unexpected depletion of user funds.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fee calculation method within the previewWithdraw function. The current calculation burns a higher proportion of shares than the intended percentage, causing the effective fee to exceed the specified rate. The fee calculation formula appears to use incorrect basis points or rounding methods, leading to an overestimate of the shares to burn.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Fee Update: WITHDRAW_FEE_UPDATER_ROLE permission has been granted to update the withdrawal fee.
2. Minting and Approval: The user (alice) must have minted tokens and approved usualX to spend them.
3. Deposit: A deposit transaction by the user into the usualX contract is required.
4. Withdraw: This is where the issue actually lies

### External pre-conditions

1. Fee Percentage: A withdrawal fee percentage (e.g., 10%) must be set in usualX.

### Attack Path

Withdrawal with Fee: The user withdraws 1 e18 worth of assets. Due to incorrect fee calculation, the contract burns 1.111111111111111112 e18 shares instead of the intended 1.1 e18, resulting in an overcharge.

### Impact

1. Overburn of Shares: Users lose more shares than the intended 10%, effectively raising the fee rate above 10%.
2. Inconsistent Asset Tracking: The totalDeposit decreases by only 10% (0.1 e18), while shares are burned at an 11% rate. This discrepancy could affect liquidity tracking over time.
3. Potential Trust Issue: Users may lose confidence in the platform due to unexpectedly high fees.


### PoC

This test can be pasted within the tests/vaults/UsualXUnit.t.sol file
```solidity
function test_wrongFeeCalculation() public {
        uint256 depositAmount = 100e18;
        uint256 fee = 1000; // 10%
        vm.prank(admin);
        registryAccess.grantRole(WITHDRAW_FEE_UPDATER_ROLE, address(this));
        usualX.updateWithdrawFee(fee);

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        ERC20Mock(usual).mint(alice, depositAmount);
        ERC20Mock(usual).approve(address(usualX), depositAmount);
        usualX.deposit(depositAmount, alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        uint shares = usualX.withdraw(1e18, alice, alice);
        vm.stopPrank(); 

        //for example
        // in a condition where the ratio of totalAsset:totalsupply  is 1:1
        //i.e  1e18 assets is equivalent to 1e18 shares. Fee excluded
        // if the fee is 1000 which is 10% it is expected to burn additional 10percent worth of shares based on the asset amount
        // i.e 10% of 1e18 == 0.1e18 asset which should then be 0.1e18 shares
        // hence 1e18 asset would then burn 1.1e18 shares. Fee included

        //howvever based on the calculation used to calculate fee. more shares are burn which is above 10% of the asset passed
        //  uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
        //     assets,
        //     $.withdrawFeeBps,
        //     BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps,
        //     Math.Rounding.Ceil
        // );

        console.log("shares", shares);//1111111111111111112

        //this result in 1111111111111111112 shares burnt instaed of the expected 1100000000000000000. taking additional over 1%


        //additional issue is
        // even after burning 11% of shares from the user it only substract the expected 10% from totaldeposit as the fee is recalculated
        // uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
        //     assets,
        //     $.withdrawFeeBps,
        //     BASIS_POINT_BASE,
        //     Math.Rounding.Ceil
        // );

        //i.e burns 11% of shares but subtract 10% of fees from totaldeposit
    }
```


### Mitigation

Fee Calculation Adjustment: Modify the fee calculation formula within the previewWithdraw function to properly reflect the intended basis points without overburning shares. A recommended approach:
```solidity
uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
```
