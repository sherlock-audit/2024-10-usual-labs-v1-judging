# User could claim more during a claim

### Summary

In the airdrop claim process, a user in the top 80% tier may choose not to pay the required tax before claiming their tokens. This results in the system calculating a reduced claimable amount based on the months passed in the vesting period. However, when the tax is not paid, the penalty calculation is incorrectly adjusted, causing the user to avoid an additional penalty that would normally be applied if the tax had been paid. This leads to the user receiving a larger claimable amount than they should have, as the penalty is computed based on fewer months than intended.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue stems from the way the penalty is calculated. Specifically, the problem arises due to the following line:

```solidity
if (isTop80) {
    penaltyAmount = _computePenalty(
        $, totalAmount, account, hasPaidTax ? monthsPassed + 1 : monthsPassed
    );
}
```
This line adjusts the penalty calculation based on whether the user has paid the tax. When the user has not paid the tax, the penalty is computed using the current number of months passed `(monthsPassed)`. However, if the user had paid the tax, the penalty would be computed using `monthsPassed + 1`, effectively adding an extra month of penalty.

### Impact

Users will receive more rewards during the claim process and will be penalized less than they should be. The system fails to apply the correct penalty for users who opt not to pay the tax, resulting in an unfair advantage where the claimable amount is higher, and the penalty is lower than intended. 

This lead to lose of funds to the protocol. 

### PoC

Let's have the following scenario:
1. A user in the top 80% tier wants to claim after exactly three months have passed. Given maxChargeableTax = 10000.
2.The user opts not to pay the tax. For instance, if the totalAmount is 1000, they would owe 500 as tax but instead choose to call the claim function directly.
3. In the claim function, this block will adjust the claimAmount to 500:
```solidity
if (isTop80 && !hasPaidTax) {
    // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
    if (monthsPassed == 0) {
        revert NotClaimableYet();
    }
    claimableAmount = totalAmount.mulDiv(monthsPassed, AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS);
}
```
Due to penalty calculations, the user will pay less in this case, as paying the fee would otherwise result in an additional month's penalty due to this line. 
```solidity
if (isTop80) {
         penaltyAmount = _computePenalty(
             $, totalAmount, account, hasPaidTax ? monthsPassed + 1 : monthsPassed
         );
     }
```
And in our situation if the user sees that the penalty for month 4 is the whole part of the 1/6 of the total claimable amount, he can decide to not pay tax and directly call the claim. 

### Mitigation

To address this issue and ensure fairness, we should enforce that users in the top 80% tier must pay the tax before they can claim their tokens. This can be done by adding a check in the claim process that prevents users from proceeding if they haven't paid the tax.
```diff
function _available(
        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $,
        address account,
        uint256 totalAmount,
        bool isTop80
    ) internal returns (uint256, uint256) {
        if (block.timestamp < AIRDROP_INITIAL_START_TIME) {
            revert NotClaimableYet();
        }

        uint256 claimableAmount = totalAmount;
        uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();
        uint256 totalClaimed = $.claimed[account];
        uint256 penaltyAmount = 0;
        bool hasPaidTax = $.airdropTaxCollector.hasPaidTax(account);

        if (isTop80 && !hasPaidTax) {
 -           // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
 -           if (monthsPassed == 0) {
 -               revert NotClaimableYet();
 -            }
 -            claimableAmount = totalAmount.mulDiv(monthsPassed, AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS);
 +           revert TaxNotPaid();
        }

        // Penalty is computed only if the account is in the top 80%
        if (isTop80) {
            penaltyAmount = _computePenalty(
                $, totalAmount, account, hasPaidTax ? monthsPassed + 1 : monthsPassed
            );
        }

        // Subtract penalties from the claimable amount
        if (penaltyAmount > claimableAmount) {
            penaltyAmount = claimableAmount;
        }

        claimableAmount -= penaltyAmount;

        if (claimableAmount <= totalClaimed) {
            revert NothingToClaim();
        }

        return (claimableAmount - totalClaimed, penaltyAmount);
    }
```
