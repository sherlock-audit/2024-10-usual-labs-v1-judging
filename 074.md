# Tax is skipped before the end of claiming period

### Summary

The rounding error in tax fee calculation will allow early claimers to skip tax before claiming period ends.

### Root Cause

The tax fee calculation is rounded down, which can cause tax fee to be 0 in case `maxChargeableTax * claimingTimeLeft < AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH` holds. So, in that case `claimTaxAmount` is 0 and the tax fee is skipped.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `maxChargeableTax` is set properly by airdrop operator
2. Prelaunch usd0++ balances are set properly for accounts
3. Blocktime is within claiming period

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. For example, airdrop operator sets `maxChargeableTax = 1000 // 10%`
2. Prelaunch usd0++ balance is set properly for `Alice`
3. `(uint(182 days) / 1000) / 1 hours = 4` hours before the end of claiming period , `Alice` claims airdrop and the tax amount to be paid by `Alice` is `0`

### Impact

- Taxes can be skipped before claiming period ends, depends on value of `maxChargeableTax`: The lower `maxChargeableTax` is set, the sooner the claimer can bypass tax. And the amount of skipped tax is dependent on account's prelaunch usd0++ balance

### PoC

Add the test below to test file `AirdropTaxCollector.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function test_calculateClaim_bypass_tax()
        public
        withMaxChargeableTax(TEN_PERCENT)
        userHasPrelaunchBalance(alice, 1000 ether)
        afterClaimingPeriodStart(AIRDROP_CLAIMING_PERIOD_LENGTH - 4 hours)
    {
        uint256 taxAmount = airdropTaxCollector.calculateClaimTaxAmount(alice);
        assertEq(taxAmount, 0);
    }
```

Run the test and console shows:
```bash
Ran 1 test for test/airdrop/AirdropTaxCollector.t.sol:AirdropTaxCollectorTest
[PASS] test_calculateClaim_bypass_tax() (gas: 58884)
Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 11.46ms (385.00Âµs CPU time)
```

### Mitigation

Consider rounding up instead of rounding down in the `taxFee` calculation
