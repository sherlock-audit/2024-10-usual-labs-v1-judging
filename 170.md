# Insiders can claim before actual cliff period passed

### Summary

Missing pause duration accounting will cause unintended early token releases for insiders as the pause periods are not added to the cliff duration, resulting in early claims.

### Root Cause

In UsualSP.sol, the `_released`() function calculates vesting periods without accounting for pause durations. When checking if the cliff period has passed, it only uses:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp < $.startDate + insiderCliffDuration) {
    revert NotClaimableYet();
}
```

This means any time spent in a paused state still counts WITHIN the cliff duration, effectively shortening the intended vesting period.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract initialized with start date and duration
2. `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` has set insider allocations and cliff durations via `allocate`()
3. Contract must be paused during cliff period

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Insiders can claim their tokens earlier than intended by the vesting schedule. For example, in a 1 month cliff period with 1 month of pause time, tokens become claimable after no time of actual vesting time.

        // Unpause
        vm.prank(admin);
        usualSP.unpause();

        // Alice can claim after only 6 months of active vesting time
        // even though cliff duration is 1 year
        vm.prank(alice);
        usualSP.claimOriginalAllocation();

        // Alice received tokens before full cliff period elapsed
        assertGt(usualS.balanceOf(alice), 0);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Track the cumulative pause duration and add it to cliff duration calculations
