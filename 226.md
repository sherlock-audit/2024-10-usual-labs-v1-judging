# Lack of Access Control in DaoCollateral.sol

### Summary

I identified a vulnerability in the provided contract, specifically within the `swapRWAtoStbc` function. The function is defined as `external` but lacks access control modifiers, meaning it can be called by any external actor. This poses a significant security risk, as unauthorized users could call this function, potentially causing unintended contract state changes or loss of funds.

### Root Cause

1. **`swapRWAtoStbc` function**:
   The function is externally callable without restrictions, and there is no access control in place to limit who can invoke it. This exposes the contract to potential unauthorized calls, as any external address can execute the function without restrictions.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The `swapRWAtoStbc` function assumes that any caller is authorized to perform the operation.
- No internal logic checks or access controls are applied to ensure that only a trusted entity can trigger the function.

### External pre-conditions

- The contract assumes the integrity of external interactions but does not validate the identity of callers, making it susceptible to unauthorized use.

### Attack Path

1. **Deploy the vulnerable contract**:
   Deploy the contract with the vulnerable `swapRWAtoStbc` function on a test network or local environment.

2. **Exploit `swapRWAtoStbc`**:
   An attacker can directly call the `swapRWAtoStbc` function, bypassing any access control checks, and potentially manipulate the contract's state or cause financial loss through unauthorized token swaps.

### Impact

Exploiting this vulnerability could result in:
- **Unauthorized state manipulation**: Malicious actors could trigger the swap function and alter the contract’s state.
- **Loss of funds**: If the function deals with token transfers or similar assets, unauthorized access could lead to loss of tokens or assets.
- **Contract abuse**: Lack of access control opens the door to various attack vectors, where attackers can execute critical functions without validation.

### PoC

The following Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates an attack where an attacker can exploit the lack of access control on the `swapRWAtoStbc` function:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./DaoCollateral.sol";

contract AttackDaoCollateral {
    DaoCollateral public daoCollateral;
    address public attackerAddress;

    constructor(address _daoCollateralAddress) {
        daoCollateral = DaoCollateral(_daoCollateralAddress);
        attackerAddress = msg.sender;
    }

    function attackSwapRWAtoStbc() public {
        // Attacker calls the swapRWAtoStbc function without any restrictions
        daoCollateral.swapRWAtoStbc(address(0), 1000, false, new uint256proval(address(0), 0));
    }
}
```

This PoC can be adapted to various testing frameworks such as Foundry, Hardhat, Truffle, or Brownie for exploitation, demonstration, and validation.

### Mitigation

To address this issue, access control modifiers such as `onlyOwner` or `onlyAdmin` should be added to restrict who can call the `swapRWAtoStbc` function. Only authorized users should be allowed to execute such sensitive functions. Here’s an example of how to implement the fix:

#### Patched Code
```solidity
function swapRWAtoStbc(
    address rwaToken,
    uint256 amountInTokenDecimals,
    bool partialMatching,
    uint256[] calldata orderIdsToTake,
    Approval calldata approval
) external onlyOwner nonReentrant whenNotPaused whenSwapNotPaused {
    _swapRWAtoStbc(
        msg.sender, rwaToken, amountInTokenDecimals, partialMatching, orderIdsToTake, approval
    );
}
```

#### Explanation of the Fix
- **Access Control**: The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the contract's owner can execute the `swapRWAtoStbc` function, preventing unauthorized users from accessing it.

### **Conclusion**
By adding access control mechanisms, such as `onlyOwner`, to the `swapRWAtoStbc` function, this vulnerability can be effectively mitigated. This will restrict the function's access to trusted parties, securing the contract from potential exploitation and ensuring that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions like token swaps.
