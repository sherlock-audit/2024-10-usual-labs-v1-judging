# Underflow Risk at `_available` Function

### Summary

The `_available function in UsualSP.sol` calculates the claimable amount for an insider by subtracting `originalClaimed[insider] from _released($, insider)`. However, this calculation is vulnerable to underflow if `originalClaimed is greater than _released`, potentially allowing a malicious user to claim an incorrect amount, resulting in contract errors or loss of funds. Adding a check to ensure originalClaimed does not exceed _released prevents this underflow, securing the calculation and ensuring accurate claim availability.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Financial Exploitation: A malicious user could attempt to manipulate values to trigger this underflow, allowing them to claim excessive tokens beyond their entitlement, leading to financial loss.

### PoC

The existing _available function does not validate that _released($, insider) is greater than or equal to $.originalClaimed[insider], which can result in underflow if originalClaimed is larger:
```javascript
function _available(UsualSPStorageV0 storage $, address insider)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256)
{
    return _released($, insider) - $.originalClaimed[insider]; // Potential underflow
}
```
In a scenario where originalClaimed[insider] is set higher than _released($, insider), this code will underflow, causing unintended results.


### Mitigation

Add a check to verify that _released($, insider) is greater than or equal to $.originalClaimed[insider]. If not, return zero or handle it with an error, indicating that no claimable amount is available. This prevents underflow and ensures the calculation is safe.
