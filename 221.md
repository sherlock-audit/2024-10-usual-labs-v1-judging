# Lack of Input Validation in DaoCollateral.sol

### Summary

I have identified vulnerabilities in the provided `DaoCollateral.sol` code, specifically within the setter functions `setRedeemFee` and `setNonceThreshold`. These functions lack proper checks to ensure that input parameters are valid. This oversight can lead to unexpected behavior or exploitation if inappropriate values are passed, potentially compromising the contract's intended functionality.

### Root Cause

1. **`setRedeemFee` function**:  
   Although the function ensures `_redeemFee` is not greater than `MAX_REDEEM_FEE`, it does not validate that `_redeemFee` meets any minimum or other constraints beyond this upper limit. This opens up the possibility of setting `_redeemFee` to `0`, which could unintentionally disable fees, affecting the contractâ€™s revenue model.

2. **`setNonceThreshold` function**:  
   This function lacks validation for the `threshold` parameter, allowing any value, including `0` or excessively high numbers, to be set. Such unchecked inputs can potentially disrupt contract logic where specific thresholds are assumed.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The `setRedeemFee` function checks `_redeemFee` against `MAX_REDEEM_FEE` but does not enforce any lower bound constraints.
- The `setNonceThreshold` function assumes that any `threshold` value is acceptable without validating its range or appropriateness for the contract's operations.
- Both functions rely on role-based access controls but assume the integrity of externally provided data.

### External pre-conditions

- The contract relies on the admin role (`setRedeemFee`) and specific permissions (`NONCE_THRESHOLD_SETTER_ROLE`) for executing these functions.
- It assumes that inputs provided by authorized users are always valid without additional validation.

### Attack Path

1. **Deploy the vulnerable contract**:  
   Deploy the `DaoCollateral.sol` contract with the vulnerable `setRedeemFee` and `setNonceThreshold` functions on a test network or local environment.

2. **Exploit `setRedeemFee`**:  
   An attacker with admin privileges can invoke `setRedeemFee` with `_redeemFee` set to `0`, effectively disabling the redemption fee. If `MAX_REDEEM_FEE` is configured to `0`, the function becomes a no-op, potentially causing financial implications.

3. **Exploit `setNonceThreshold`**:  
   Similarly, an attacker with the `NONCE_THRESHOLD_SETTER_ROLE` can set an excessively high or low threshold value via `setNonceThreshold`, leading to unexpected behavior or logic bypasses within the contract.

### Impact

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could result in:
- **Financial impact**: Setting the redemption fee to `0` could lead to loss of revenue from operations that rely on this fee.
- **Contract logic disruption**: Assigning arbitrary values to `nonceThreshold` could compromise mechanisms that depend on the threshold, potentially leading to security or operational failures.
- **Unexpected contract behavior**: Lack of input validation may lead to erroneous state changes, reducing the reliability and integrity of the contract.

### PoC

The following Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the unchecked setter functions:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity 0.8.20;

import "./DaoCollateral.sol";

contract AttackDaoCollateral {
    DaoCollateral public daoCollateral;

    constructor(address _daoCollateralAddress) {
        daoCollateral = DaoCollateral(_daoCollateralAddress);
    }

    function attackSetRedeemFee(uint256 fee) public {
        // Assumes attacker has admin privileges
        daoCollateral.setRedeemFee(fee);
    }

    function attackSetNonceThreshold(uint256 threshold) public {
        // Assumes attacker has NONCE_THRESHOLD_SETTER_ROLE
        daoCollateral.setNonceThreshold(threshold);
    }
}
```

This PoC can be adapted to various testing frameworks such as Foundry, Hardhat, Truffle, or Brownie for exploitation, demonstration, and validation.

### Mitigation

To address these issues, I recommend adding robust input validation checks in the affected functions:

#### Patched Code for `setRedeemFee`
```solidity
function setRedeemFee(uint256 _redeemFee) external {
    if (_redeemFee > MAX_REDEEM_FEE) revert RedeemFeeTooBig();
    if (_redeemFee < MIN_REDEEM_FEE) revert RedeemFeeTooSmall(); // New check for a minimum fee
    _requireOnlyAdmin();
    DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
    if ($.redeemFee == _redeemFee) revert SameValue();
    $.redeemFee = _redeemFee;
    emit RedeemFeeUpdated(_redeemFee);
}
```

#### Patched Code for `setNonceThreshold`
```solidity
function setNonceThreshold(uint256 threshold) external {
    if (threshold < MIN_THRESHOLD || threshold > MAX_THRESHOLD) revert InvalidThreshold(); // New check for threshold range
    DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
    $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(NONCE_THRESHOLD_SETTER_ROLE);
    $.nonceThreshold = threshold;
    emit NonceThresholdSet(threshold);
}
```

### **Explanation of the Fix**
- **`setRedeemFee`**: Ensures `_redeemFee` is above a defined minimum (`MIN_REDEEM_FEE`), preventing unintended fee removal.
- **`setNonceThreshold`**: Adds bounds checking to ensure the `threshold` falls within a predefined range (`MIN_THRESHOLD` to `MAX_THRESHOLD`), mitigating the risk of setting disruptive values.

### **Conclusion**
By implementing these validation checks, the smart contract will be safeguarded against unintended behavior and unauthorized access, improving overall security and stability.
