# `releasedAmount` will be incorrectly calculated for allocations created **after** `startDate` in `UsualSP`.

### Summary

Protocol has confirmed that it will create allocations using `UsualSP::allocate()` **after** the `startDate` but these allocations will have incorrect released amount.

### Root Cause

The `insiderCliffDuration` of `allocations` that were created **after** the `startDate` will be compared to the `startDate` and not to the actual timestamp that the allocation created. As a result, the `insiderCliffDuration` doesn't represent the actual cliff duration of the given allocation meaning that the insider will be able to release some amounts **earlier**. Let's see the `UsualSp::allocate()` function that will be called so to create allocations and it will be called sometimes **after** the `startDate` :
```solidity
    function allocate(
        address[] calldata recipients,
        uint256[] calldata originalAllocations,
        uint256[] calldata cliffDurations
    ) external {
        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE);

          // ...

        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
            // ...

            _updateReward(recipients[i]);

            $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = originalAllocations[i];
@>            $.cliffDuration[recipients[i]] = cliffDurations[i];

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        emit NewAllocation(recipients, originalAllocations, cliffDurations);
    }
```

As you see, regardless of when the `allocate` has been called (either before or after the `startDate`), the given `cliffDuration` is attached to the `cliffDuration` mapping of the insider. Let's now see the `UsualSP::_released()` that calculates the amount of vested amount that has been released until now :
```solidity
    function _released(UsualSPStorageV0 storage $, address insider)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 insiderCliffDuration = $.cliffDuration[insider];

        uint256 totalMonthsInCliffDuration = insiderCliffDuration / ONE_MONTH;
        uint256 totalAllocation = $.originalAllocation[insider];

@>        if (block.timestamp < $.startDate + insiderCliffDuration) {
          //...
@>        } else if (block.timestamp >= $.startDate + $.duration) {
         // ...
        } else {
            // Calculate the number of months passed since the cliff duration
@>            uint256 monthsPassed =
                (block.timestamp - $.startDate - insiderCliffDuration) / ONE_MONTH;

            // Calculate the vested amount based on the number of months passed
            uint256 vestedAmount = totalAllocation.mulDiv(
@>                totalMonthsInCliffDuration + monthsPassed,
                NUMBER_OF_MONTHS_IN_THREE_YEARS,
                Math.Rounding.Floor
            );

            // ...
        }
    }
```

As we can see, the `cliffDuration` is handled like it had started from the `startDate`, however this is not always the case. It is incorrectly added `cliffDuration` to `$.startDate` like this is the `block.timestamp` that the unvesting could be starting. This is incorrect because this would mean that not the actual duration will have been passed from the time that the vesting got created.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Team calls `UsualSP::allocate()` for an insider **after** the `startDate` which is confirmed that they will do it.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

No special attack path, just normal confirmed behaviour of protocol. Creating allocations for insiders **after** the `startDate`.

### Impact

Impact : Medium - Some insiders will get their tokens released sooner than it was intended violating in this way the required `cliffDuration` since they will not wait this duration but less.
Likelihood : High - Protocol has confirmed (and it is logical in vesting situations) that will do it, so it is 100% likelihood.

The impact of this vulnerability is that the insiders for whom the protocol will create allocations *after** the `startDate` will be able to release their tokens sooner. The amount of insiders that will benefit from this is indefinite as well as the duration that they will "steal".
