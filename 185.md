# Incorrect claim tracking in ```claimOffChainDistribution``` results in claim blocking for eligible users.

### Summary

The ```claimOffChainDistribution``` function incorrectly updates the ```claimedByOffChainClaimer``` mapping, setting it to the total assigned ```amount``` rather than tracking cumulative claims. This results in a situation where a user’s subsequent claim attempts for the same amount will revert, preventing them from fully accessing their eligible distribution.

### Root Cause

The [paragraph](https://usual.gitbook.io/usual-technical-documentation/Aw3jUdIChYIRnEPcqUqK/smart-contracts/protocol-contracts/usual-distribution) from the protocol documentation has the following information:
_The merkle tree root that is queued should be calculated off-chain and should include account and amount values for each user that is eligible for claiming the off-chain distribution. The amount value should be the total amount of tokens that were assigned for the given account address since the beginning of the distribution. The amount value for the given account should never decrease. The account address should be in the format 0x123... and the amount should be in wei._


According to the protocol documentation above, the Merkle tree root should be calculated off-chain, including each eligible account and its total assigned amount since the beginning of the distribution. Importantly, the amount for each account should never decrease. This function design flaw blocks users from claiming their entitled amounts after the first claim. Protocol team also confirmed that this function is to be called several times by the user, not just once.
The ```claimOffChainDistribution``` function stores ```amount``` in the ```claimedByOffChainClaimer``` mapping after each call to this function by the user. Ideally it should increment it with the ```amountToSend``` value instead of assigning ```amount```. In the subsequent call by the user to this function it will revert due to the following check: 

  ```solidity
uint256 claimedUpToNow = $.claimedByOffChainClaimer[account];

        if (claimedUpToNow >= amount) {
            revert NoTokensToClaim();
        }
```

Even if the ```amount``` differs between distributions ```claimedByOffChainClaimer``` will only store the recent claim not cumulative amount. This will result in the ```amountToSend``` be only differences of the ```amount``` values between 2 calls and requires that each time the ```amount``` value be higher than the last ```amount``` value.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

User calls claimOffChainDistribution(account, amount, proof) for the first time. 

uint256 claimedUpToNow = $.claimedByOffChainClaimer[account] is now equals ```amount```. 

Next call will revert.


### Impact

The protocol suffers from functionality disruption as eligible users are unable to claim any additional distribution amounts they might be entitled to, based on updates in the Merkle root. Users’ token claims are prematurely halted after their first attempt, reducing protocol usability and leading to user frustration.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Overall design of the function is a bit flawed. The ```amountToSend``` is calculated by subtracting ```claimedUpToNow``` from the ```amount```. A better calculation is needed to get ```amountToSend``` and increment ```claimedByOffChainClaimer``` by the ```amountToSend```  after each call.
