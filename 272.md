# `burnFrom` requires unBlacklisting a blacklisted address , a malicious actor can backrun the `unBlacklist` call to transfer tokens causing the burn to fail

### Summary

Usd0, Usual and UsualS have a burnFrom function that allows an adress with the burn role to burn tokens of another address.The issue is that if the address is blacklisted the burn will fail and unblacklisting the address will allow the user to **frontrun** the burn by transferring the tokens to another address, causing the burn to fail in this case too.

### Root Cause

In the `_update` function in [Usd0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0.sol#L161-L171) [Usual](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usual.sol#L147-L157) [UsualS](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualS.sol#L234-L244) the operation reverts if the `from` or `to` address is blacklisted. This function is called during a `burnFrom` (burnFrom -> _burn -> _update) , this means a permissioned actor(i.e. with the burn role) cannot burn from a blacklisted address  and unblacklisting the address to burn the tokens will allow the malicious actor to backrun the unblacklisting or frontrun the burn by trandferring their tokens to another address causing the burn to revert due to insufficient tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

Address to be burned from must be blacklisted


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Medium - broken functionality, the burner (actor with the burn role) should be able to burn from any and all addresses


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

This can be mitigated by skipping the blacklist check on burn oprations ( i.e. when `_update` is called with `to == address(0)`).
Example:
```solidity

    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        internal
        virtual
        override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable, ERC20Upgradeable)
    {
        Usd0StorageV0 storage $ = _usd0StorageV0();
        if (to != address(0) && ($.isBlacklisted[from] || $.isBlacklisted[to])) {
            revert Blacklisted();
        }
        super._update(from, to, amount);
    }
```
