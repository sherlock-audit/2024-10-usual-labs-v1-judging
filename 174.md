# Nonce can Overflow by Using `invalidateUpToNonce`

### Summary

In NoncesUpgradeable, _invalidateUpToNonce() can be called to set the nonce to max uint256. Because _useNonce() does not check for overflows, nonce can then be incremented to overflow and loop back around to 0.

This could cause users to accidentally allow the replay of all of their transactions or cause problems for the frontend when nonces are used multiple times.

### Root Cause

Unchecked nonce increment here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/utils/NoncesUpgradeable.sol#L57

Invalidate allows any legitimate uint256 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/utils/NoncesUpgradeable.sol#L75

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Wherever invalidateUpToNonce can be used, make it the highest uint256 possible.
2. Use the nonce legitimately until it overflows.
3. Your nonces will be reset back to 0.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Resetting nonce will confuse and cause problems with any workers off-chain and allow replays.

It can cause effects like keeping the user constantly on the same partially matched nonce while continually resetting match amount by invalidating https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L790.

It could be used maliciously or accidentally when a user invalidates to max, uses a nonce normally, then all of their transactions can be replayed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove `unchecked` in nonce, or invalidate up to a certain value (such as +1000 from current nonce).
