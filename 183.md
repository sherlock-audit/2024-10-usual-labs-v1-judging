# Potential Front-Running Vulnerability in burnFrom Function Allows Unauthorized Redemption Before Role-Based Restriction Enforcement

### Summary

The `burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)` function in `Usd0.sol` :: `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0.sol#L142` in the contract is susceptible to a front-running attack. Since burnFrom can be delayed by a front-runner, an attacker could front-run the burnFrom call to execute functions like redeem and other token-based actions before the burn effectively reduces their balance. This exploit occurs because the role-based access control on burnFrom does not prevent a third party from observing and preempting the call with high-priority transactions. Consequently, by front-running burnFrom, an attacker could redeem tokens or perform other balance-dependent actions prior to the intended reduction in their token balance, undermining the contractâ€™s balance management.

### Root Cause

In Usd0.sol:142 function burnFrom, the absence of a mechanism to prevent front-running on burnFrom is a mistake as it allows an attacker to execute balance-dependent functions like redeem before their balance is reduced by the burn operation.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `USD0_BURN` calls `burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)` with appropriate arguments on `Usd0` contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.	Attacker Front-Runs the Transaction: Observing the pending burnFrom transaction, an attacker with prior access to the account quickly initiates balance-dependent functions such as redeem or similar functions reliant on the current balance.
	2.	Execution of Balance-Dependent Functions: Before the burnFrom transaction executes, the attacker successfully redeems tokens or completes other balance-dependent actions, extracting value from the protocol or increasing their gains.

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of token value as balances can be redeemed based on pre-burn amounts. The attacker gains the difference by redeeming tokens at an inflated balance before the burn executes.
