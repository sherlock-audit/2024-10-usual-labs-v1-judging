### Attack Path

The protocol implements the [`UsualSP.removeOriginalAllocation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L367) function within `UsualSP` contract as it is needed to be executed under several scenarios:

1. If the user's original allocation has to be decreased, the only method to do so is to first remove the allocation via the `removeOriginalAllocation` function and re-allocate it with the new value via the `allocate` function.
1. If the user's original allocation has to be removed entirely, the `removeOriginalAllocation` has to be triggered.

Assume Bob's original allocation is $X$ at T1, and $A$ number of USUALS has vested at this point.

The operator decided to decrease Bob's allocation by half to $0.5 X$ at T2. Thus, the operator will need to execute the `removeOriginalAllocation` function first, followed by the `allocate` functions within a single transaction, and submit it to the mempool.

Bob sees the transaction in the mempool and decides to front-run the operator's transaction by claiming whatever USUALS have already been vested (e.g., $A$), and this will lead to `$.originalClaimed[Bob] = A`. Bob receives $A$ USUALS tokens.

When the operator's transaction is executed, `$.originalClaimed[Bob]` will be reset to zero. Since `$.originalClaimed[Bob]`, the protocol will assume that Bob has not claimed any USUALS token yet. 

Thus, Bob could claim a portion of $A$ USUALS tokens ($0.5 A$) again, as if he has not claimed anything before. The protocol ignores the fact that Bob has already claimed $A$ USUALS tokens previously.

As a result, Bob receives $1.5 A$ USUALS tokens, effectively allowing him to double claim vested USUALS.

```solidity
File: UsualSP.sol
367:     function removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients) external {
368:         if (recipients.length == 0) {
369:             revert InvalidInputArraysLength();
370:         }
371: 
372:         UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
373:         $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE);
374: 
375:         for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
376:             $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
377:             $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;
378: 
379:             emit RemovedOriginalAllocation(recipients[i]);
380:             unchecked {
381:                 ++i;
382:             }
383:         }
384:     }
```

### Impact

Malicious users could claim more USUALS than expected, effectively stealing the USUALS from other users.

Severity: High as malicious users can steal USUALS.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider keeping track of the number of vested USUALS that a user has already claimed even after `removeOriginalAllocation` function has been executed.
