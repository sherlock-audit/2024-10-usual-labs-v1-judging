# DistributionModule continues to operate after the full distribution has completed.

### Summary

The Usual distribution model uses the D parameter to set the portion of the total distribution to be distributed in a year. As per the documentation, it is meant to be immutable and set to 0.25, meaning a quarter of the full distribution per year, or four years for the full distribution:

 (from [the technical documentation](https://usual.gitbook.io/usual-technical-documentation/Aw3jUdIChYIRnEPcqUqK/overview/architecture/usual-distribution-model) ) 

> *"The distribution rate is immutable and set to 0.25 meaning we will plan to fully distribute the minting rate per the market cap of current locked assets over 4 years total."*

however, the distribution contract does not halt it's execution once the full distribution if complete, and if the distribution operator (who per the readme is only trusted to make daily calls to distributeUsualToBuckets/queueOffChainUsualDistribution) continues to call these functions, the contract will continue to mint Usual distributions beyond the documented allocation and potentially indefinitely.

Note that pausing the contract is not a viable solution because this will also pause claims for accounts that haven't yet claimed their full distribution.

### Root Cause

Root cause is the lack of a mechanism to track the ratio of full distribution already distributed and to halt distribution when full distribution is complete.

see [distributeUsualToBuckets](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/distribution/DistributionModule.sol#L649)

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The full distribution has finished (if D remains 0.25 then 4 years, or if D is changed to another value, the new full term that can be derived from the change).
2. DistributionOperator continues to call queueOffChainUsualDistribution. (note that although this is a privileged role, it's privilege is limited to calling distributeUsualToBuckets/queueOffChainUsualDistribution daily and therefore it can not be assumed that it is trusted to halt at the appropriate point)

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. DistributionModule is deployed and operates as intended
2. Four years go by (For this example the value of D is not changed, meaning the full intended mint period is over).
3. The distribution operator continues to call distributeUsualToBuckets
4. The mint/distribution continues past the intended full distribution as per the documentation.

### Impact

Over-inflation through minting distribution beyond the documented full amount. This over-distribution can continue indefinitely and therefore the amount is unbound. The result is loss through Usual de-valuation for all Usual holders.

### PoC

1. Add the following function to DistributionModule.t.sol
2. run forge test --match-test test5years -vvv
3. Note that the distribution continues well past the intended 4 years, or any total period derived from the value of D.

```solidity
function test5years() public {
       
        for (uint256 i = 1; i < 365*5; i++) {
           
            skip(DISTRIBUTION_FREQUENCY_SCALAR);
            uint256 supplyBefore = usualToken.totalSupply();
            vm.prank(distributionOperator);
            distributionModule.distributeUsualToBuckets(545+i,551+i);
            uint256 supplyAfter = usualToken.totalSupply();
            if (i % 20 == 0 ) {
                console2.log("usual total supply diff: %s day %s", supplyAfter-supplyBefore,i);
            }
        }
    }
```

### Mitigation

1. Add a storage variable _usedPortion that tracks how much of the "whole" distribution had been used up. For every call to distributeUsualToBuckets aggregate to it the value of D/365 (with some percision decimals). 
2. When the aggregator reaches one, the contract disables further distributions and only enables offline claims.

This will correctly track the part of the whole distribution completed, including if D is changed at some point midway.
