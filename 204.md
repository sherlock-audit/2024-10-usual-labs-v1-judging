# Incorrect Fee Calculation Inflates Share Value

### Summary

Mismatched fee calculations between previewWithdraw and withdraw will cause share price inflation for current vault holders as withdrawing users receive correct assets but a smaller fee deduction from totalDeposits inflates totalAssets(), leading to higher assets per share value.


### Root Cause

In UsualX.sol at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L326 there is a critical mismatch in fee calculations:
```solidity
// previewWithdraw - Burns shares worth (assets + higher fee)
fee = (assets × withdrawFeeBps) / (BASIS_POINT_BASE - withdrawFeeBps)

// withdraw - Deducts smaller fee from totalDeposits
fee = (assets × withdrawFeeBps) / BASIS_POINT_BASE
```
When user withdraws, they burn shares calculated using the higher fee from previewWithdraw, but totalDeposits is reduced by the smaller fee amount. The difference between these fees, which was meant to be part of (balance - totalDeposits) reserved for future yield distribution or other purposes that protocol is yet to decide, is instead immediately distributed to remaining holders through inflated totalDeposits. Inflated totalDeposits causes totalAssets() to return inflated values, which directly increases assets per share for remaining holders.

### Attack Path

1. User calls previewWithdraw(100) with 1% fee, gets shares worth 101.01 tokens
2. User calls withdraw(100), burning the 101.01 worth of shares which is internally calling previewWithdraw
3. However, only 1.00 tokens (not 1.01) are deducted from totalDeposits in withdraw
4. The 0.01 difference, meant for future yield, is effectively distributed to current holders as totalDeposits remains artificially high

### Impact

The vault suffers from share price inflation where remaining holders get higher assets per share than expected.
