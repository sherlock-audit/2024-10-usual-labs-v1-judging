# Lack of update rewards in removeOriginalAllocation

### Summary

The missing update rewards in [UsualSP:367](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L367-L377), will cause the staker lose some rewards.

### Root Cause

In [UsualSP:367](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L367-L377), when we try to remove one original allocation, we just remove `originalAllocation` and `originalClaimed`. The problem is that this operation will change this staker's staking balance. It will cause the staker lose one part of staking rewards.

```solidity
    function removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients) external {
        ...
        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
            $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
            $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;
             ...
        }
    }
    function balanceOf(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        return
            $.liquidAllocation[account] + $.originalAllocation[account] - $.originalClaimed[account];
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` allocates Alice 1e18 original allocation in timestamp A. Then Alice starts to accure some rewards from timestampA with the balance 1e18.
2. After a period of time, `USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE` decides to remove Alice's original allocation via `removeOriginalAllocation` in timestamp B. Then Alice's staking balance will become to 0.
3. When Alice wants to claim the staking rewards between timestampA and timestampB, Alice will get 0 amount because her balance is 0.

### Impact

Stakers who have some original allocations may lose some expected rewards.

### Mitigation

Timely update rewards in function `removeOriginalAllocation()`.
