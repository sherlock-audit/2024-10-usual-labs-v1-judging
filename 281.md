# Vault inflation attack in UsualX allows malicious user to steal money and innocent user to lose money

### Summary

The missing check: `require(convertToShares(assets) != 0);` in `usualX::depositWithPermit(...)` allows the attacker to perform and fully beneficiate from his attack at low cost as he takes advantage of a rounding issue.

### Root Cause

There's a rounding issue here:
in `convertToShares(...)` called in the subcalls of deposit()

### Internal pre-conditions

1. totalAsset()==0, totalSupply()==0

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A hacker back-runs the transaction of an ERC4626 pool creation.
2. The hacker mints for themself one share: deposit(1). Thus, totalAsset()==1, totalSupply()==1.
3. The hacker front-runs the deposit of the victim who wants to deposit 20,000 usual (20,000).
4. The hacker inflates the denominator right in front of the victim: asset.transfer(20_000*dec). Now totalAsset()==20_000*dec + 1, totalSupply()==1.
5. Next, the victim's tx takes place. The victim gets 1 * 20_000*dec / (20_000*dec + 1) == 0 shares. The victim gets zero shares.
6. The hacker burns their share and gets all the money.

### Mitigation

Add the following check: `require(convertToShares(assets) != 0);`or implement the 'dead shares' technique [used by UniswapV2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/ee547b17853e71ed4e0101ccfd52e70d5acded58/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L121)
