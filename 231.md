# Lack of Input Validation in DaoCollateral.sol

### Summary

I have identified a vulnerability in the provided code, specifically within the `swapWithPermit` function in the `DaoCollateral.sol` contract. The vulnerability arises from the absence of a check to ensure that the `rwaToken` address is not the zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`). This oversight can lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities when interacting with a contract at the zero address, potentially causing the loss of funds or causing the contract to malfunction.

### Root Cause

1. **Missing Zero Address Check in `swapWithPermit` function**:  
   The function does not validate that the `rwaToken` address passed as an argument is not the zero address. Without this check, the contract may attempt to interact with an invalid address, which could lead to failed transactions or loss of funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The function assumes that the `rwaToken` address provided is valid. If the address is set to the zero address, the contract will attempt to interact with an invalid address, leading to failure or unexpected behavior.

### External pre-conditions

- The contract relies on the `rwaToken` address being a valid ERC20 token that implements the `permit` function. If this address is not valid (i.e., the zero address), the contract may attempt to interact with a non-existent token contract.

### Attack Path

1. **Deploy the vulnerable contract**:  
   Deploy the `DaoCollateral.sol` contract with the vulnerable `swapWithPermit` function to a test network or local environment.
   
2. **Exploit the missing zero address check**:  
   An attacker can invoke the `swapWithPermit` function with the zero address as the `rwaToken`. Since the function does not check for this, it will proceed with calling the `permit` and `swap` functions, leading to a failed transaction or unintended behavior without error feedback.

### Impact

Exploiting this vulnerability could result in:
- **Unintended behavior**: The contract may attempt to interact with a non-existent token contract, leading to failed transactions.
- **Loss of funds**: If the contract interacts with the zero address, it could cause loss of funds or tokens due to interacting with an invalid address.
- **Security breach**: Malicious actors could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause unexpected contract failures, leading to potential disruptions or financial losses.

### PoC

The following Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the missing zero address check in the `swapWithPermit` function:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity 0.8.20;

import "./DaoCollateral.sol";

contract AttackDaoCollateral {
    DaoCollateral public daoCollateral;

    constructor(address _daoCollateralAddress) {
        daoCollateral = DaoCollateral(_daoCollateralAddress);
    }

    function attackSwapWithPermit() public {
        address zeroAddress = address(0);
        uint256 amount = 1000;
        uint256 minAmountOut = 100;
        uint256 deadline = block.timestamp + 1 hours;
        uint8 v = 27; // Example v
        bytes32 r = 0x0; // Example r
        bytes32 s = 0x0; // Example s

        // Exploiting the missing zero address check
        daoCollateral.swapWithPermit(zeroAddress, amount, minAmountOut, deadline, v, r, s);
    }
}
```

This PoC can be adapted to various testing frameworks such as Foundry, Hardhat, Truffle, or Brownie for exploitation, demonstration, and validation.

### Mitigation

To address this issue, I recommend adding a check at the beginning of the `swapWithPermit` function to ensure that the `rwaToken` address is not the zero address before proceeding with the permit and swap operations. Here's an updated version of the code with the check:
#### Patched Code

```solidity
function swapWithPermit(
        address rwaToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external {
        // Ensure rwaToken is not the zero address
        require(rwaToken != address(0), "DaoCollateral: rwaToken address cannot be the zero address");
        
        // Attempt to call the permit function
        try IERC20Permit(rwaToken).permit(msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s) {} 
            catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
        
        // Proceed with the swap
        swap(rwaToken, amount, minAmountOut);
    }
```

### **Explanation of the Fix**
- The `require(rwaToken != address(0), ...)` line ensures that if the `rwaToken` is set to the zero address, the transaction will revert with a clear error message (`"DaoCollateral: rwaToken address cannot be the zero address"`).
- This prevents the function from calling `permit` or `swap` with an invalid address, protecting against unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

### **Conclusion**
By adding this zero address check, the smart contract will be safeguarded against unexpected behavior or potential loss of funds that could occur when interacting with invalid addresses. This simple validation improves the security and stability of the contract.
