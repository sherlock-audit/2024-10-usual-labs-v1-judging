# swapWithPermit Functionality Restriction

### Summary

The `swapWithPermit` function in the contract
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L710-L723)
 attempts to use the permit function of an ERC-20 token to approve a transfer, but restricts this functionality by using msg.sender as the owner parameter in the permit call. This approach limits the permit feature, preventing third-party addresses (such as relayers) from submitting the transaction on behalf of the owner. While this does not result in a loss of funds or introduce a security vulnerability, it breaks the expected functionality of off-chain approvals as defined in EIP-2612.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L710-L723)
The `swapWithPermit` function hardcodes msg.sender as the owner in the call to IERC20Permit(rwaToken).permit(...), meaning only the original signer can call swapWithPermit, instead of allowing any authorized address (e.g., a relayer) to perform the action.

### Internal pre-conditions

The swapWithPermit function is designed to allow an ERC-20 token transfer with an off-chain approval.
The permit function validates the owner of the approval signature to authorize the spender.
The swapWithPermit function is expected to support gasless transactions via relayers by allowing any caller to execute the function.


### External pre-conditions

The owner must sign a valid permit message off-chain, authorizing the contract to spend tokens on their behalf.
A third-party caller, such as a relayer, should be able to invoke swapWithPermit using the off-chain permit signature.


### Attack Path

Not applicable: This issue does not present an exploitable path for attackers. It simply restricts the intended functionality by requiring msg.sender to match the owner who signed the permit, preventing third-party addresses from calling swapWithPermit.


### Impact

- Severity: Low

- Impact Description: The impact is limited to broken functionality. By using msg.sender as owner, the function prevents third-party relayers from calling swapWithPermit on behalf of the owner. This diminishes the usability of the permit feature but does not pose a security risk or cause financial loss.

### PoC

1. A user signs a permit message off-chain, authorizing address(this) to spend amount tokens on their behalf.

2. A relayer or third-party address attempts to execute swapWithPermit using the signed permit parameters.

3. The transaction fails unless msg.sender matches the original owner of the permit signature, breaking the intended functionality for off-chain approvals by third parties.


### Mitigation

To enable relayer functionality and restore the intended use of permit, modify swapWithPermit to accept an owner parameter rather than hardcoding msg.sender. This change allows any authorized caller to submit the signed permit on behalf of the owner.
```solidity
function swapWithPermit(
    address owner,
    address rwaToken,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
) external {
    try IERC20Permit(rwaToken).permit(owner, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s) {} 
    catch {}

    swap(rwaToken, amount, minAmountOut);
}
```

This modification enables swapWithPermit to work as intended by EIP-2612, allowing any authorized address to call the function with a valid off-chain permit signature, thereby enabling gasless transactions and allowing for broader usability.
