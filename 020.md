# Penalties imposed on airdrop recipients in the first period (from start time to the first vesting date) will not have effect

### Summary

The airdrop system enables the AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE to set penalties per recipient and per month, using the setPenaltyPercentages function. However, if the penalty operator sets a penalty for month 0 (which represents the first period between start time and the first vesting point) the penalty will not take effect because of the way penalties are calculated in _computePenalty.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is in a discrepancy between how penalties are set in _computePenalty and how they are computed in  _computePenalty:

the setPenaltyPercentages function enables setting penalties starting from month 0:

(From AirdropDistribution.sol line 368)
```solidity
 uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();

  // Validate the month is within the 6-month vesting period
  if (month < monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) {
      revert OutOfBounds();
  }
```
monthsPassed is determined in [_calculateMonthsPassed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L267) and starts at 0 for the first period (start to first vest).

However, in _computePenalty the penalties are calculated starting month 1 and up to (and including) the monthsPassed the function receives:
```solidity
function _computePenalty(
        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $,
        uint256 totalAmount,
        address account,
        uint256 monthsPassed
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        uint256 penaltyAmount = 0;
        uint256 oneSixthAmount =
            totalAmount.mulDiv(1, AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= monthsPassed; i++) {
```
This means that if a user 'misbehaved' during month 0 and got a penalty for it, that penalty will not take effect when the user claims and have their overall penalty calculated.




### Internal pre-conditions

1. AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE needs to apply a penalty for some users during the first period (start time to first vesting time).

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A top 80 airdrop claimant has a total allocation of 1200 Usual.  
2. The user 'misbehaves' during the first period (from airdrop start to first vest) and has a 100% penalty set by the  AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE for that period (month 0).
3. The imposed penalty should be 100% of the first period vesting (1200/6 = 200).
4. If the user calculates that the tax they would need to pay at the end of month 0 (for the remaining 5 months) is less than the penalty, they can completely avoid the penalty by paying the tax towards the end of the first period and then claiming their entire allocation. Because   _computePenalty ignores the month 0 penalty, they end up with 1200Usual minus the tax, which is net positive for them compared to paying the penalty.
5. Even if the tax has a higher value than the penalty, the user will still get away with skipping the penalty, as long as no one notices the error and corrects it.




### Impact

The total amount of penalties avoided in this way is bounded by a sixth of the total airdrop allocation. This amount will be wrongfully minted to airdrop claimants causing dilution of the value of Usual that would decrease the value of Usual holdings for all Usual holders. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. In setPenaltyPercentages enable penalties to be set from month 0 to month 5 
2. In _computePenalty have the loop calculate from 0 to monthsPassed (up to 5): `for (uint256 i = 0; i < monthsPassed; i++) {` instead of `for (uint256 i = 1; i <= monthsPassed; i++) {`
3. In _available, change the call to computePenalty from: `penaltyAmount = _computePenalty(
                $, totalAmount, account, hasPaidTax ? monthsPassed + 1 : monthsPassed);` to `penaltyAmount = _computePenalty(
                $, totalAmount, account, monthsPassed);`

This will create a more consistent penalty setting/calculation that enables setting a penalty during each of the vesting periods that can not be avoided by paying the tax in cases where it is cheaper than the penalty.
