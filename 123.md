# Missing Function for Handling UsualX Tokens Transfer in UsualX.sol Contract

### Summary

The `UsualX.sol` contract lacks a function to handle the transfer of `UsualXTokens`, despite the fact that its documentation states such functionality should be present. This discrepancy may lead to confusion for developers interacting with the contract, as the expected token transfer function does not exist. If this function is necessary for the contract's operation, its absence may cause failure in expected workflows, such as transferring tokens between addresses, handling token-based transactions, or implementing token logic within the contract.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Contract Incomplete: The absence of a token transfer function makes the contract incomplete according to its documentation, potentially violating expectations set for its users.
Failed Token Transfers: If the contract relies on the transfer of UsualXTokens, the lack of a function to manage this transfer can cause critical functionality to break. This could hinder users or other contracts from interacting with UsualXTokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

**Add the Transfer Function:** Implement a function to transfer UsualXTokens to another address. This function should interact with the UsualXToken contract to transfer the specified amount of tokens to the provided recipient.
