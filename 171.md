# Lack of Slippage Tolerance in _swapRWAtoStbc Function

#### Summary
The`swapRWAtoStbc`: `_swapRWAtoStbc` function, used to swap RWA tokens for USD0 stablecoins, is vulnerable to slippage due to reliance on oracle data that can change between initial price quotation and transaction execution. Without a slippage tolerance mechanism, users may receive a lower-than-expected amount of stablecoins when the oracle price fluctuates unfavorably, leading to unexpected losses.

### Vulnerability Details
The [_swapRWAtoStbc](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L775C7-L778C6) function aims to facilitate the exchange of RWA tokens for USD0 by first obtaining a price quote from an oracle using the _getQuoteInUsd function. This oracle provides the USD equivalent value of the specified RWA token amount, which the function then uses to mint the corresponding USD0 tokens. Once minted, these USD0 tokens are sent to the SwapperEngine to swap for USDC, completing the exchange process. However, the function lacks a slippage control mechanism. This means it does not verify if the actual amount of USD0 or USDC received post-swap meets a minimum threshold that the user might expect. Without this slippage tolerance, if the oracle price fluctuates unfavorably during the transaction, the user could end up with a lower amount of USD0 or USDC than anticipated, resulting in unexpected value loss and exposing users to significant financial risk.

### Impact
The lack of slippage protection could cause a potential loss of value for users exchanging RWA tokens for USD0 or USDC due to fluctuating oracle prices. Users may receive a lower amount than anticipated without any safeguard, which could harm user confidence and increase financial risk.

> The vulnerability arises from reliance on a potentially volatile oracle price. Thereâ€™s no slippage tolerance parameter, which would let the user define a minimum acceptable amount of USD0 or USDC to receive.

### Recommendation
Implement a slippage tolerance mechanism where users can specify a minimum acceptable amount of USD0 (or USDC) they expect to receive. If the amount is less than the threshold due to oracle price fluctuation, the transaction should revert to prevent unexpected losses.
