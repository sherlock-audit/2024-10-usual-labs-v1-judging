# Users' airdrop may be penalized twice

### Summary

The improper month check in [AirdropDistribution:371](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L371-L373) allows penalty update for month `monthsPassed`. This may cause users' airdrop penalized twice.

### Root Cause

In [AirdropDistribution:setPenaltyPercentages](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L371-L373), `AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE` can update some accounts' penalty percentage. From the input month parameter check , we can find out that valid input month range should between `monthsPassed` and 6, including `monthsPassed`.
The problem is that users can claim `monthsPassed`'s rewards, and we will clear `$.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i]` to 0, this means that we have penalized this `monthsPassed`.
If the `setPenaltyPercentages` happens after users' claim, when they try to reclaim their airdrop next month, they have paid the last month's penalty again.

For example:
1. The time is 2025-01-15. Now the `monthsPassed` is 1.
2. Alice claims her airdrop for this first month and pay the current penalty.
3. The admin wants to update Alice's penalty percentage for month 1. Note: Admin thinks this is one valid input now. Admin is trusted and they will not be intend to update penalty percentage after he finds out Alice's airdrop. Considering the network congestion situation, this sequence can still happen.
4. When the time comes to 2025-02-15, `monthsPassed` is 2.
5. Alice claims her airdrop for the second month and need to pay the month 1's penalty again.

```solidity
    function setPenaltyPercentages(
        uint256[] memory penaltyPercentages,
        address[] memory accounts,
        uint256 month
    ) external {
        uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();

        // Validate the month is within the 6-month vesting period
@>        if (month < monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) {
            revert OutOfBounds();
        }
        ...
    }
    function _computePenalty(
        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $,
        uint256 totalAmount,
        address account,
        uint256 monthsPassed
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        uint256 penaltyAmount = 0;
        uint256 oneSixthAmount =
            totalAmount.mulDiv(1, AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= monthsPassed; i++) {
            // We can get the valud if i = 7, because this is one mapping, not array.
            if ($.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i] == 0) {
                continue;
            } else if ($.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i] == BASIS_POINT_BASE) {
               ...
            } else {
                uint256 monthlyPenalty =
                    oneSixthAmount.mulDiv($.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i], BASIS_POINT_BASE);
                penaltyAmount += monthlyPenalty;
            }
@>            $.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i] = 0;
        }
        return penaltyAmount;
    }
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The time is 2025-01-15. Now the `monthsPassed` is 1.
2. Alice claims her airdrop for this first month and pay the current penalty.
3. The admin updates Alice's penalty percentage for month 1. 
4. When the time comes to 2025-02-15, `monthsPassed` is 2.
5. Alice claims her airdrop for the second month and need to pay the month 1's penalty again.


### Impact

Alice has to pay for the first month's penalty twice.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Users can claim their airdrop in month `monthsPassed`. So admin role should not update penalty percentage for the month `monthsPassed`
