# UsualSP::removeOriginalAllocation does not call _updateRewards causing user to lose all rewards earned from the allocation

### Summary

_updateRewards is meant to accrue a user rewards to state and should be called before making any change to the users balance to ensure that the user doesnt lose rewards or earn too much 
however  when removeOriginalAllocation is called, this doesnt happen causing the user too lose the rewards along with the allocation
