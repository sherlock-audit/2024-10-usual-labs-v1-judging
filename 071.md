# `deposit`/`mint` functions are missing the `whenNotPaused` modifier




### Summary
 
From the `depositWithPermit` function, it can be inferred that deposits are meant to be disabled when the contract is paused, but users can still deposit by accessing the `deposit` and `mint` functions.

### Root Cause

`depositWithPermit` holds the `whenNotPaused` modifier which prevents deposit with permit when the vault is paused. When the contract is paused, users should not be able to deposit.

```solidity
    function depositWithPermit(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
        try IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), assets, deadline, v, r, s) {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
            catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks

        return deposit(assets, receiver);
    }
```

But this can be bypassed by users directly depositing using the `deposit`/`mint` function. This is because the functions are not overriden from their base [ERC4626Upgradeable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/YieldBearingVault.sol#L14) contract and as a result are still usable even when contract is paused. Coupled with the fact that the shares can still be transferred when paused, users can easily mint or deposit when the contract is paused, bypassing the `depositWithPermit` functionality.

```solidity
    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        internal
        override(ERC20Upgradeable)
    {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        if ($.isBlacklisted[from] || $.isBlacklisted[to]) {
            revert Blacklisted();
        }
        super._update(from, to, amount);
    }
```
