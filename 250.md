`balance of the user = liquidAllocation[user] + originalAllocation[user] - claimed[user]` [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L446)

Since `rewards` earned by a user is directly related to the token `balance` of the user , it is necessary to update the `rewards` of any user before his token balance is changed.[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/modules/RewardAccrualBase.sol#L136-L138)

+            _updateReward(recipients[i]);
             $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
             $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;
