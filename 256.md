# Pausing mechanism is not implemented correctly

### Summary
The `UsualX` contract has the pausing mechanism. If this contract is paused, depositors can't withdraw their assets from it. However, depositing to the paused contract is still possible. As a result, users who deposited to the paused contract can't withdraw their assets. It causes the loss of fund to the user.

### Root Cause
There is no `whenNotPaused` modifier to the `deposit()` and `mint()` function while the `withdraw()` and `redeem()` function have it.

```solidity
319:    function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) 
            public
            override
            whenNotPaused
            nonReentrant
            returns (uint256 shares)

353:    function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner)
            public
            override
            nonReentrant
            whenNotPaused
            returns (uint256 assets)
```

### Internal pre-conditions
The `UsualX` contract is paused.

### External pre-conditions
Users deposit to the paused contract.

### Attack Path
N/A

### Impact
Users who deposited to the paused `UsualX` contract can't withdraw their assets.

### PoC
N/A

### Mitigation
It is recommended to add pausing mechanism to the `deposit()` and `mint()` functions.
