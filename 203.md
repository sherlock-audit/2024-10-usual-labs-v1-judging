# Users Can Circumvent Bond Maturity Restriction via unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice

### Summary

The `unwrap` function in the Usd0PP contract enforces a four-year bond period, disallowing users from redeeming their bonded USD0 tokens prematurely. However, users can bypass this restriction by calling the `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice` function, which allows them to unlock and transfer their bonded USD0 based on the floor price without any time-based restrictions.

When user transfer the USDO token in USDOPP contract they get 1:1 ratio of USDOPP in back means if user passed 500 USDO they get 500 USDOPP token in return.  determines the USDOPP price also stays near the USDO which is $1 there are differnent way to maintain that peg, such as `unWrapPegmanitainer` and `UpdateFloorPrice` which is used to keep price pegged to USDO.

But the USDOPP contract have `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice` which allows user who have minted the USDOPP, to burn and get back USDO before the maturity period ends, which breaks main invariant and cause following issue. 
 
There can be multiple issue from this , 
-> The protocol want user to stake until the 4 year period for that reason they incentivising user with airdrop (it's clear from because if user rage quits early they won't get any usual rewards). but user could call this function and withdraw before 4 year and also claim there rewards from `airdropDistribution` contract  after claiming the USUAL  rewards for 6 months till june 12.

-> If they Keep amount of USOPP which is required to receive USUAL reward and get included in merkle root. As the merkle root will not be updated again,  they can claim for few month and withdraw when-ever they wish

->or After claiming usual rewards for 6 month they will call `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice` and withdraw, hence receiving usual tokens + deposited USDO. 

when user mint and unwrap exchange happens at the 1:1 ratio of tokens, but if user call `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice` they still get the price equal to USDO, because as it start from the  INITAL_FLOOR_PRICE and to get best price user could back-running  the `UpdateFloorPrice` function which allows to set the value max upto 1e18, and USDO also have 1e18 price as stable coin, so they can get best price by doing so.

```solidity
   function unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice(uint256 usd0ppAmount) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        if (usd0ppAmount == 0) {
            revert AmountMustBeGreaterThanZero();
        }
        if (balanceOf(msg.sender) < usd0ppAmount) {
            revert InsufficientUsd0ppBalance();
        }
        Usd0PPStorageV0 storage $ = _usd0ppStorageV0();

        if ($.floorPrice == 0) {
            revert FloorPriceNotSet();
        }

        // as floorPrice can't be greater than 1e18, we will never have a usd0Amount greater than the usd0 backing
        uint256 usd0Amount = Math.mulDiv(usd0ppAmount, $.floorPrice, 1e18, Math.Rounding.Floor);

        _burn(msg.sender, usd0ppAmount);
        $.usd0.safeTransfer(msg.sender, usd0Amount);

        // Calculate and transfer the delta to the treasury
        uint256 delta = usd0ppAmount - usd0Amount;
        if (delta > 0) {
            address treasury = $.registryContract.getContract(CONTRACT_TREASURY);
            $.usd0.safeTransfer(treasury, delta);
        }

        emit Usd0ppUnlockedFloorPrice(msg.sender, usd0ppAmount, usd0Amount);
    }

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/Usd0PP.sol#L432


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. user/attacker deposited in the USDOPP Contract.
2. Merkle root is updated by protocol as they deposited how much protocol mentioned to deposit in-case  to receive USUAL rewards 
3. airdrop distribution started after claiming for 6 months the USUAL Rewards.
4. use/attacker calls  `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice` withdraw by seeing when is the best price

### Impact

user could exchange USDOPP for USDO, before the end of 4 year rime-period ends, which breaks the main invariant for locking tokens for 4 years

### Mitigation

Restrict the `unlockUsd0ppFloorPrice` function or implement the time-based unlocking or charging them Fee to withdraw at Floor price.
