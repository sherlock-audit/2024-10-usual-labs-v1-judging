# Wrong Implementation of Permit in depositWithPermit

### Summary

The `depositWithPermit function in the UsualX.sol
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L297-L309
 has a limitation in its use of permit due to the hardcoded msg.sender as the owner parameter in the permit call. This issue restricts the function from leveraging the intended off-chain approval feature of EIP-2612 permit, which allows other addresses (such as relayers) to execute transactions on behalf of the owner. While this issue breaks the intended functionality, it does not result in a loss of funds or create security vulnerabilities.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L297-L309

The function call to IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(...) passes msg.sender as the owner parameter, meaning only the original signer can execute depositWithPermit. This limits the permit functionality to the signer, rather than allowing any authorized third party to complete the transaction.

### Internal pre-conditions

The depositWithPermit function is expected to execute a transfer with off-chain approval.
The contract includes a permit function that validates the owner of the approval signature.
The function is designed to be called by any address, potentially enabling gasless transactions through relayers.

### External pre-conditions

The owner must have signed a valid permit message off-chain.
A caller (ideally any address, such as a relayer) should be able to invoke the depositWithPermit function and utilize the permit functionality.


### Attack Path

This issue does not provide a path for attackers to exploit; it only restricts functionality by requiring msg.sender to be the owner, thus limiting the use of off-chain approval by third parties.


### Impact

Severity: Low
Impact Description: The impact is limited to broken functionality for permit. While users can still call depositWithPermit, they cannot leverage the intended off-chain approval for gasless transactions via relayers. This reduces usability but does not cause loss of funds or create a security vulnerability.

### PoC

- A user signs a permit message off-chain authorizing address(this) to spend assets on their behalf.

- A relayer or third-party tries to execute depositWithPermit using the signed permit parameters.

- The transaction fails unless the relayer's msg.sender matches the original owner who signed the permit, breaking the expected functionality.


### Mitigation

 Modify depositWithPermit to accept an owner parameter rather than hardcoding msg.sender. This allows any address to call depositWithPermit using a valid off-chain signature, as intended by EIP-2612.
 
 ```solidity
function depositWithPermit(
    address owner,
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
    try IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(owner, address(this), assets, deadline, v, r, s) {} 
    catch {}

    return deposit(assets, receiver);
}

```
