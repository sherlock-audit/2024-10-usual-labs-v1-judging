# Lack of Duplicate Address Check in accounts Array May Lead to Excessive Gas Costs and Potentially Inconsistent State

### Summary

The `setPenaltyPercentages` function does not include a mechanism to check for duplicate entries in the `accounts` array. This lack of duplicate address validation can lead to redundant updates, increased gas consumption, and potential inconsistencies in penalty assignments.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the absence of a check in the `setPenaltyPercentages` function that would prevent duplicate entries in the accounts array. Consequently, the function permits multiple updates to the same address within a single transaction.

```solidity
    function setPenaltyPercentages(
        uint256[] memory penaltyPercentages,
        address[] memory accounts,
        uint256 month
    ) external {
        uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();

        // Validate the month is within the 6-month vesting period
        if (month < monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) {
            revert OutOfBounds();
        }

        // Validate the length of the arrays
        if (penaltyPercentages.length != accounts.length) {
            revert InvalidInputArraysLength();
        }

        AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $ = _airdropDistributionStorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            if (penaltyPercentages[i] > BASIS_POINT_BASE) {
                revert AmountTooBig();
            }
            if (penaltyPercentages[i] == $.penaltyPercentageByMonth[accounts[i]][month]) {
                revert SameValue();
            }
            $.penaltyPercentageByMonth[accounts[i]][month] = penaltyPercentages[i];
        }

        emit PenaltyPercentagesSet(accounts, penaltyPercentages, month);
    }
```

### Impact

The presence of duplicate addresses causes the function to execute redundant operations, leading to significantly higher gas consumption.

### Mitigation

Duplicate Address Check:

```solidity
mapping(address => bool) seenAddresses;

for (uint256 i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
    // Check if the address has been seen before
    if (seenAddresses[accounts[i]]) {
        revert DuplicateAccount();
    }
    seenAddresses[accounts[i]] = true;
    
   .....
}

```
