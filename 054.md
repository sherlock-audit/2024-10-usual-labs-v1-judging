# Small loss of shares for Users due to how fee is calculated in ``previewWithdraw``.

### Summary 
In `UsualX`, a amount of withdrawal fees is taken in withdraw and redeem. 
In `previewWithdraw` ,fee calculation is different than in withdraw function which causes fees calculated from previewWithdraw to be greater than  in withdraw due to subtracting ``withdrawFeesBps``.

```solidity 
uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
      assets,
      $.withdrawFeeBps,
@>    BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, 
      Math.Rounding.Ceil
    );
```
### Root Cause
In `previewWithdraw` , deducting withdrawFeesBps from BASIS_POINT_BASE increase extra fee.
### Internal pre-conditions
_NO_RESPONSE
### External pre-conditions
_NO_RESPONSE 
### Attack Path  
1. User deposit 100 tokens gets 100 shares.
2. Consider withdrawFeeBps = 500 // 5% , User withdraw 50 tokens.
3. User receive 50 tokens ,fee = 6 tokens , left shares = 100 -( 50 + 6 ) = 44 tokens.
The state for ``yeild.totalDeposits`` will be updates but it deducts 5 tokens as the added fees is 6 tokens in ``previewWithdraw``.
### impact 

- user will always pay an extra share when withdrawing.

### POC
Fess calculation of previewWithdraw and withdraw are different.
Consider withdrawFeeBPs = 500 , same values as in attack path.
[previewWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L396)
```solidity 
uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
      assets,
      $.withdrawFeeBps,
@>    BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, 
      Math.Rounding.Ceil
    );

    fee = (100 * 500)/ (10000 - 500 )= 50000 / 9500 = 5.2 = 6.
```
[withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L336)
```solidity 
    uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
      assets,
      $.withdrawFeeBps,
      BASIS_POINT_BASE,
      Math.Rounding.Ceil
    );

    fee = (100 * 500)/ (10000 )= 50000 / 10000 = 5.
```

### MIGATION 
remove the  withdrawFeeBps deducted in BASIS_POINT_BASE.
```diff 
uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(
      assets,
      $.withdrawFeeBps,
--    BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps,
++    BASIS_POINT_BASE , 
      Math.Rounding.Ceil
    );
```
