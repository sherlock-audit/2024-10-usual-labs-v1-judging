# Missing Chain ID and Address Verification will Lead to Cross-Chain Replay Attacks Impacting User Fund Security

### Summary

Missing Chain ID and address verification in the `claim` function will cause a **cross-chain replay attack vulnerability** for **users** as **malicious actors** will **replay the claim transaction on a different chain during a hard fork, potentially leading to unauthorized fund claims and financial losses**.

### Root Cause

In `AirdropDistribution.sol`'s `claim` function, there is a missing verification that `msg.sender` is the same as `account`, allowing any address to claim for any account.(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L314)
In `AirdropDistribution.sol`'s `_verifyMerkleProof` function, there is no inclusion of `block.chainid` in the proof generation, making it vulnerable to cross-chain replay attacks during a hard fork.(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L305)

### External pre-conditions

- The blockchain network needs to experience a hard fork, creating a secondary chain where transactions can be replayed.
- The attacker must be able to monitor and capture `claim` transactions on the original chain to replay them on the forked chain.

### Attack Path

1. **User** calls `claim` on the original chain to claim their airdrop.
 
2. **Attacker** monitors the blockchain and captures the transaction data of the `claim` function, including the proof and parameters used in the claim.
 
3. **Blockchain network** undergoes a hard fork, creating a secondary chain where transactions can be replayed.
 
4. **Attacker** replays the captured `claim` transaction on the forked chain, bypassing any address verification since `msg.sender` is not required to match the `account`.
 
5.`Attacker` successfully claims the airdrop for the same `account` on the forked chain, leading to unauthorized access to the airdrop tokens and potential financial losses for the user.


### Impact

**The protocol** suffers from **potential token dilution and loss of trust**. Users may perceive the protocol as insecure if replay attacks are possible, potentially impacting the protocol’s credibility and future user engagement.
**Users** may face confusion as a result of unintended double claims on separate chains, potentially complicating the management of their assets across chains.

### Mitigation

1.Add Chain ID Verification in MerkleProof
In `_verifyMerkleProof`, include `block.chainid` in the leaf node generation to ensure the proof is valid only on the intended chain, thereby preventing cross-chain replay attacks.
Code :
```diff
function _verifyMerkleProof(
    AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $,
    address account,
    bool isTop80,
    uint256 totalAmount,
    bytes32[] calldata proof
) internal view returns (bool) {
+    // Include block.chainid in the Merkle proof to prevent cross-chain replay attacks
-    bytes32 leaf = keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(account, totalAmount, isTop80))));
+    bytes32 leaf = keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(block.chainid, account, totalAmount, isTop80))));
    return MerkleProof.verify(proof, $.merkleRoot, leaf);
}
```
2.Introduce EIP-712 Signature Verification
Using EIP-712 signature verification, ensure that only the account owner can call the **claim** function, preventing unauthorized actions. Here, **ECDSA** is used to verify the signature. The EIP-712 domain separator **domainSeparator** is initialized and used to validate the account owner’s signature in the **claim** function.
Code:
1.Define the EIP-712 Domain Separator:
```diff
+bytes32 private constant DOMAIN_TYPEHASH = keccak256("EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)");
+bytes32 private constant CLAIM_TYPEHASH = keccak256("Claim(address account,bool isTop80,uint256 amount)");

+bytes32 private domainSeparator;

function initialize(address _registryContract) public initializer {
    // Other initializations...

+    domainSeparator = keccak256(abi.encode(
+        DOMAIN_TYPEHASH,
+        keccak256(bytes("AirdropDistribution")),
+        keccak256(bytes("1")),
+        block.chainid,
+        address(this)
+    ));
}
```
2.Add Signature Verification in the claim Function:
```diff
function claim(address account, bool isTop80, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof, bytes calldata signature)
    external
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
{
    if (account == address(0)) {
        revert NullAddress();
    }
    if (amount == 0) {
        revert AmountIsZero();
    }

+    // Verify signature using EIP-712
+    bytes32 digest = keccak256(
+        abi.encodePacked("\x19\x01", domainSeparator, keccak256(abi.encode(
+            CLAIM_TYPEHASH,
+            account,
+            isTop80,
+            amount
+        )))
+    );
+    require(ECDSA.recover(digest, signature) == account, "Invalid signature");

    AirdropDistributionStorageV0 storage $ = _airdropDistributionStorageV0();

    if (!_verifyMerkleProof($, account, isTop80, amount, proof)) {
        revert InvalidProof();
    }

    if ($.ragequit[account]) {
        revert AirdropVoided();
    }

    (uint256 amountToClaim, uint256 penaltyAmount) = _available($, account, amount, isTop80);

    $.claimed[account] += amountToClaim + penaltyAmount;
    $.usualToken.mint(account, amountToClaim);
    emit Claimed(account, amountToClaim);
}
```
These adjustments add Chain ID validation to restrict claims to the intended chain, and EIP-712 signature verification to ensure only the account owner can execute the claim function, thus preventing unauthorized access and cross-chain replay attacks.
