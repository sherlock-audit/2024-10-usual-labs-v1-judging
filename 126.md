# Malicious Actor can withdraw others UsualXTokens

### Summary

In the `UsualX.sol::withdraw` the current implementation of the withdraw function contains a vulnerability where a `malicious owner can withdraw assets` on behalf of other users, potentially `bypassing the correct share distribution and withdrawal limits`. This issue arises because the function does not properly check or restrict the ownerâ€™s ability to withdraw assets for other users. Specifically, the `owner address` is passed as a parameter, and the function allows the caller to withdraw assets on behalf of any owner, which could be abused.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Malicious Withdrawals: A malicious owner could withdraw assets from other users' shares by passing their own address as the owner parameter. This undermines the trust in the system, as users could lose assets or be unable to withdraw their own fund

### PoC

Below is the vulnerable code from the contract:
```javascript 
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
    public
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 shares)
{
    UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
    YieldDataStorage storage yieldStorage = _getYieldDataStorage();

    // Check withdrawal limit
    uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
    if (assets > maxAssets) {
        revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
    }
    // Calculate shares needed
    shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
    uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

    // Perform withdrawal (exact assets to receiver)
    super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);

    // Take the fee
    yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
}
```
In this code, the withdraw function allows the caller to withdraw assets for any owner by specifying an owner address. A malicious actor can call this function with an owner address that is not their own, effectively withdrawing assets for someone else

### Mitigation

Verify that the msg.sender is the same as the owner
