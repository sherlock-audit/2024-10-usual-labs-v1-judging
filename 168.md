# wrong price calculation in st will cause incorrect calculations

### Summary

The St value is a supply factor that adjusts the minting rate of USUAL tokens based on the supply of USD0++ (or the underlying collateral asset). Essentially, as the supply of USD0++ increases, the minting rate for USUAL decreases, and vice versa.

How St is Calculated:
St is designed to be inversely proportional to the supply of USD0++. In simple terms, when more USD0++ is minted and enters circulation, the value of St decreases, which in turn reduces the minting rate of USUAL tokens. On the other hand, when the supply of USD0++ decreases, the St value increases, boosting the minting rate.

Ceiling of 1:
To prevent minting from becoming too small when the supply of USD0++ is low, St has a ceiling of 1. This means if the supply of USD0++ ever falls below its initial amount (the Supply++ at launch), the St factor will be capped at 1. This serves as a safeguard, ensuring that the minting rate doesn't go to zero, even when the collateral supply is low.

Impact of Supply++:
If the supply of USD0++ surpasses its initial launch supply, the St value will drop below 1. This adjustment prevents excessive minting of USUAL tokens as the supply of USD0++ increases, helping to keep the minting rate in line with the growth of the collateral supply.
however while calculating the st the code fetches the initial price wrong which will lead to incorrect calculations

in the calculatedistributions function the function calls st with current token price

which calls the _getUSD0Price to fetch the latest price token

then it calls the st to calculate the st

in the st the pt = current price
and p0 = price at the time of deployment
however when we look at p0 it incorrectly calls _getUSD0Price which fetches the latest token price which is incorrect and lead to wrong calculations

this will fetch the latest token price which will then be used to calculate the current st
