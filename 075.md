# USUALS Loss Risk Due to Overwritten Allocations with Mutual Allocators

### Summary

The possibility of creating multiple Allocations with different cliff periods, distributed amounts, and distinct allocators introduces a risk. 
If two allocations share a mutual allocator, only one allocation will be considered in the distribution of USUALS tokens, leading to a loss of funds for the user.

### Root Cause

In [Allocate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L327) the USUALSP_OPERATOR can allocate a specific amount of tokens to users.

Consider the following scenario:

Allocation 1: 1-year cliff, 3.6 million USUALS, with users Alice and Bob.
Allocation 2: 2-year cliff, 5 million USUALS, with users David, Jack, and Bob.

In this setup, Bob is present in both allocations. 
Ideally, he should receive a total of 8.6 million USUALS across the vesting period, divided as follows:

Year 1: ~1.2 million USUALS from Allocation 1
Year 2: ~1.2 million USUALS from Allocation 1 + ~3.4 million USUALS from Allocation 2
Year 3: ~1.2 million USUALS from Allocation 1 + ~1.6 million USUALS from Allocation 2

However, [due to the following code section](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L350-L357), when this scenario occurs, rather than checking if the user already has an existing allocation and updating it, the new allocation simply replaces the initial one.

At this point, Bob will receive only the 5 MLN USUALS, and he's not even able to [claim the original allocation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L239) after a year because the 3.6 MLN USUALS allocation it's been replaced from the 5 MLN allocation, and the cliff period now is 2 Years instead 1 Year.




### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1) USUALSP_OPERATOR creates an allocation for Alice and Bob: 3.6 MLN, 1 Year cliff
2) USUALSP_OPERATOR creates an allocation for Jack, David and Bob: 5 MLN, 2 Year cliff
3) Bob First allocation is replaced by the second one, leading to a loss of funds for BOB that will receive only 5 MLN instead 8.6

### Impact

Loss of funds for users that should receive the original allocation in USUALS.

        // BOB get's only 5 MLN USUALS instead 8.6 MLN
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        usualSP.claimOriginalAllocation();
        vm.stopPrank();


        console.log("usualS.balanceOf(bob) after claim", usualS.balanceOf(bob));
        console.log("");
    }

```

### Mitigation

 If an allocation already exists, the function allocate(), should either only update the allocation instead of replacing it with the new one.
