# min amount check while redeeming is insufficient at protecting users from receiving less than they want

### Summary

when users call redeem to redeem RWA tokens for stablecoins function takes a minamount parameter The minAmountOut parameter represents the minimum amount of rwa  the user expects to receive . however the minamount check is broken and does not protect users. The function calls _burnStableTokenAndTransferCollateral and reverts if the amount received from _burnStableTokenAndTransferCollateral is less than min amount however the function is broken

when we look at _burnStableTokenAndTransferCollateral the function checks if the amount is 0 and reverts if its is 0 however it does not take the min amount check and and burns the stable amount of the user and then proceeds to transfer the collateral back to the user this is problematic since when the redeem function reverts the stable amount of the user will already be burned and collateral already transferred this does nothing to protect users

    function _burnStableTokenAndTransferCollateral(
        address rwaToken,
        uint256 stableAmount,
        uint256 stableFee
    ) internal returns (uint256 returnedCollateral) {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        // we burn the remaining stable token
        uint256 burnedStable = stableAmount - stableFee;
        // we burn all the stable token USD0
        $.usd0.burnFrom(msg.sender, stableAmount); ///@audit burns


        // get the amount of collateral token for the amount of stablecoin burned by calling the oracle
        returnedCollateral = _getTokenAmountForAmountInUSD(burnedStable, rwaToken);
        if (returnedCollateral == 0) {
            revert AmountTooLow();
        }


        // we distribute the collateral token from the treasury to the user
        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20
        IERC20Metadata(rwaToken).safeTransferFrom($.treasury, msg.sender, returnedCollateral); ///@audit transfers
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

loss of funds for users The function also gives users a false sense of security and is inefficient at protecting them

### PoC

user calls redeem function with minamount
function calls burnstableandtransfercollateral
the function burns the users stable balance
then transfers the collateral amount 
user receives less than he was entitled to due to sandwich or slippage attack

### Mitigation

check if the amount received matched the min amount properly before transferring/burning users balance
