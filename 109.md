# setPenaltyPercentages() can set the penalty of the current month, causing claimer can skip the penalty or pay it twice

### Summary

`AirdropDistribution.setPenaltyPercentages()` allows the operator to set the penalty of the current month, which causes the user can skip the penalty by claiming before the setting, or the user can pay the penalty twice if the operator decides to re-setting

### Root Cause

In [`AirdropDistribution.sol:371`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L371), the contract allows the operator to set the penalty percentage of users in the current month:
```solidity
    function setPenaltyPercentages(
        uint256[] memory penaltyPercentages,
        address[] memory accounts,
        uint256 month
    ) external {
        uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();

        // Validate the month is within the 6-month vesting period
>>>     if (month < monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) { 
            revert OutOfBounds();
        }
        ...
```




### Internal pre-conditions

1. `AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE` needs to call to setPenaltyPercentages() function to set the penalty percentage of users in the current month

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Case 1:
Assuming the `block.timestamp` is just over `12th Jun 2025` (aka `SIXTH_AIRDROP_VESTING_CLAIMING_DATE`), meaning the month passed for vesting is `6`
1. The `AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE` naively assumes that it's okay to set the penalty of the current month (month 6), so they're about to call to `setPenaltyPercentages()`
2. User acknowledge that, call `claim()` before the operator calling `setPenaltyPercentages()` -> successfully skip the penalty of the month 6

Case 2:
Assuming the `block.timestamp` is just over `12th Jan 2025` (aka `FIRST_AIRDROP_VESTING_CLAIMING_DATE`), meaning the month passed for vesting is `1`
1. `AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE` call to `setPenaltyPercentages()` to the user
2. User call to `claim()`, paying the penalty of month 1 as expected
3. `AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE` decide to call to `setPenaltyPercentages()` again to change the fee of some user
4. User calls to `claim()` in the next month or so, still paying the penalty of month 1 that they are already paid

### Impact

In case 1: The user will skip the need to pay tax
In case 2: The user will need to pay for the penalty twice in the same month 

### Mitigation

```diff
    function setPenaltyPercentages(
        uint256[] memory penaltyPercentages,
        address[] memory accounts,
        uint256 month
    ) external {
        uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();

        // Validate the month is within the 6-month vesting period
-       if (month < monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) { 
+       if (month <= monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) { 
            revert OutOfBounds();
        }
        ...
```
