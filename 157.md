# clam airdrop will be temporarily DoSe'd for claimers who didnt pay tax

### Summary

a top 80% user who didnt pay tax and decided to claim the airdrop every month rather than the whole amount in one go will have to wait longer than he should be to claim the airdrop amount he is entitled to 
when a user calls claim in airdropdistribution.sol

it calls available to check how much is available to claim

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L222

in the available function the amount the top 80% user who didnt pay tax can claim is calculated as

        claimableAmount = totalAmount.mulDiv(monthsPassed, AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS);

now the problematic part is this check

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L260-L261

this function check if the claimable amount is less than or equal to totalclaimed amount and reverts if the claimable amount is less this is problematic let me explain

The claimable amount is how much the user is eligible to claim

Total claimed tracks the amount the user has already withdrawn from their total airdrop allocation.

when we have a closer look at how claimable amount for the user is calculated

            claimableAmount = totalAmount.mulDiv(monthsPassed, AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS);

now imagine total amount =600 
AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS= 6

When monthsPassed = 1:claimableAmount = 600×(1/6)=100        total claimed = 100
When monthsPassed = 2:claimableAmount = 600×(2/6)= 200        total claimed = 100+200=300
When monthsPassed = 3:claimableAmount = 600×(3/6)= 300        

now claimable = 300 which is equal to total claimed which will trigger the

        if (claimableAmount <= totalClaimed) {
            revert NothingToClaim();

now the user will wait for 1 more month

4 months passed = claimableAmount = 600×(4/6)=400  now the check will be bypassed 400>300
 total claimed = 300+400 = 700 

5 months  passed =  claimableAmount = 600×(5/6)=500 now the check will revert again 500>700

user will wait 1 more month 

6 months passed = claimableAmount=600×(6/6)=600 now the check will revert again 600>700

### Internal pre-conditions

whenever the claimable amount is less than total claimed

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

loss of funds for users and temporary DoS of the airdrop claim function
