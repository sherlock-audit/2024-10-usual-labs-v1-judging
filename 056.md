# The user will withdraw funds with less fee from protocol or first depositor will make share price much bigger.

### Summary

Wrong calculation of fee in `UsualX.sol#withdraw()` will cause loss of fees for protocol as the user will withdraw funds by making share price bigger.
And an attacker will make share price much bigger by using this vulnerability so will cause loss of funds for depositors and break protocol.

### Root Cause

- In `UsualX.sol:336` there is wrong calculation of fee which is different from `UsualX.sol:396~398(previewWithdraw)`.
  Fee calculated on `L336` is less than calculated on `L396~398`.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `WITHDRAW_FEE_UPDATER` sets `withdrawFeeBps` to `5%(= 500)`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- An attacker, first depositor deposits `100e18`. Then, he receives `100e18` of shares.
- Then, the attacker withdraws `(95e18 - 1)`. Shares burnt becomes `ceil( (95e18 - 1) * 1.00 / 0.95 ) = 100e18 - 1`. 
  So only `1 wei` of share is remained to the attacker.
  And fee calculated on L336 is `95e18 * 0.05 / 1.00 = 4.75e18`.
  So after withdraw, remained `yieldStorage.totalDeposits` becomes `100e18 - 95e18 - 4.75e18 = 0.25e18`, not `zero`.
- So share price becomes `0.25e18 / 1 = 0.25e18`.
- Then, a user deposits `0.3e18` and he receives only `0.3e18 * 1 / 0.25e18 = 1 wei` of share.
- Then, share price becomes `(0.25e18 + 0.3e18) / 2 = 0.275e18`.
- So user loses `0.025e18`.
- And share price becomes much bigger.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from unexpectedly increasing share price and less fee. And much bigger share price can break protocol and loss of funds for users.   
The protocol loses fee as `(1 / (1 - feeBps) - 1) * feeBps` share of assets.

### Mitigation

`UsualX.sol#withdraw()` function has to be modified as follows.
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
        public
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        UsualXStorageV0 storage $ = _usualXStorageV0();
        YieldDataStorage storage yieldStorage = _getYieldDataStorage();

        // Check withdrawal limit
        uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
        }
        // Calculate shares needed
        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
-       uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
+       uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE - $.withdrawFeeBps, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

        // Perform withdrawal (exact assets to receiver)
        super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);

        // take the fee
        yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
    }
```
