# user can void getting penalty  by front running `` setPenaltyPercentages `` .

### Summary 
In `AirdropDistribution:claim`, user can claim for airdrop using 4 options lets consider options 2 and 3 :

>2. Tax Paid Early Claim (Top 80% - Tax paid): These users, while originally part of a vesting schedule, can pay a tax to skip the vesting. Once the tax is paid, they can claim the total amount directly without waiting for monthly releases.
>3. Vested Claim (Top 80% - No Tax Paid): These users must follow the vesting schedule, which allows monthly claims between January 12th and June 12th. 


If the user misbehaves then penalty is applied to the user but User can frontrun `setPenaltyPercentages` function by paying tax early and claiming.
### Root cause 
In `AirdropDistribution:claim`, there is no check to prevent frontrunning of `setPenaltyPercentages`.
### Internal pre-conditions
_NO_RESPONSE_
### External pre-conditions
1. User should in group Top 80.
### Attack Path
1. User misbehaves which will get him penaltied.
2. User front-runs  ``setPenaltyPercentages`` transaction , pays  tax  and calls claim ``AirdropDistribution:claim`` to claim all airdrop from all vesting scheldule .
3. User receives tokens without getting penaltied.
### Impact 
user can avoid penaltied  by fron running `setPenaltyPercentages`
### POC
_NO_RESPONSE_
### Migation 
we could prevent frontrun by using timelocks but not sure how we could prevent user who has already paid tax .
