# Users will lose  a significant portion of their collateral for negligible returns

#### Summary
The [_swapRWAtoStbc](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L612)function allows users to swap Real World Assets (RWA) tokens for USD0, which are then exchanged for USDC. The function has an option for partialMatching to be enabled, meaning the swapper can partially match the user's swap request if full liquidity isn’t available. However, the function lacks a mechanism to set a minimum acceptable threshold for matched USD0 when partialMatching is enabled.

### Scenario 
```solidity
   IERC20Metadata(rwaToken).safeTransferFrom(caller, address(this), amountInTokenDecimals);
        // Get the price quote of the RWA token to mint USD0
        uint256 wadRwaQuoteInUSD = _getQuoteInUsd(amountInTokenDecimals, rwaToken);
        // Mint the corresponding amount of USD0 stablecoin
        $.usd0.mint(address(this), wadRwaQuoteInUSD);
        if (!IERC20($.usd0).approve(address($.swapperEngine), wadRwaQuoteInUSD)) {
            revert ApprovalFailed();
        }
        // Provide the USD0 to the SwapperEngine and receive USDC for the caller
        uint256 wadRwaNotTakenInUSD =
            $.swapperEngine.swapUsd0(caller, wadRwaQuoteInUSD, orderIdsToTake, partialMatching);

        // Burn any unmatched USD0 and return the RWA
        if (wadRwaNotTakenInUSD > 0) {
            if (!IERC20($.usd0).approve(address($.swapperEngine), 0)) {
                revert ApprovalFailed();
            }
            $.usd0.burnFrom(address(this), wadRwaNotTakenInUSD);
```
In this scenario, Alice requests to swap 1000 RWA-Tokens for USDC with partial matching enabled. Due to low liquidity in the SwapperEngine, only 10% of her requested swap can be matched, meaning only 100 USD0 is minted and swapped for 100 USDC. The remaining 900 USD0 is burned. As a result, Alice receives far less than the expected amount of USDC and incurs a significant loss of value, as the contract burns the unfulfilled portion of her tokens without any safeguard or minimum acceptable amount to protect her from such outcomes.

> When Alice tries to swap her RWA tokens for USDC, the contract uses the SwapperEngine to match her order against available offers in the market.
If there isn’t enough liquidity (i.e., enough offers that can fulfill her entire swap), only a partial match is made. This means that Alice will receive only a portion of the amount of USDC she expected, and the rest of the swap won't be fulfilled.

### Impact
The low liquidity in the SwapperEngine triggers partial matching, and without a minimum acceptable amount check, Alice can end up with a very small return, even though she provided a much larger amount of tokens for the swap.

### Recommendation
Introduce a Minimum Acceptable Amount parameter to protect users from this situation. This would allow Alice to set a threshold (e.g., "I must receive at least $500 worth of USDC for this transaction to proceed"). If the partial match does not meet this threshold, the contract should revert the transaction, ensuring Alice does not end up losing value due to low liquidity.
