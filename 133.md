```solidity
File: AirdropDistribution.sol
363:     function setPenaltyPercentages(
364:         uint256[] memory penaltyPercentages,
365:         address[] memory accounts,
366:         uint256 month
367:     ) external {
368:         uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();
369: 
370:         // Validate the month is within the 6-month vesting period
371:         if (month < monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) {
372:             revert OutOfBounds();
373:         }
```

The above checks ensure that the `month`, in which the penalty should be set is:

- `month` not already passed
- `month` is not equal to 7 or more

This means the `month` can be the current month OR future months (as long as below 7)

Assume that Bob's allocation is 600. and his penalty is zero. This means 100 USUAL will be vested per month.

Assume that three (3) months have already passed. This means that Bob has already earned the entire `300 (100 * 3)` USUAL since three months have already passed.

However, the operator could still go back in time and set the penalty for `$.penaltyPercentageByMonth[Bob][3] = 100%`. As a result, Bob can still lose the entire 100 USUAL in the third month even though 3 months already passed, and he is entitled to the full sum of 300 USUAL.

Following is the extract from the protocol team's response taken from the ["Cantina Usual Pegasus: Phase 1" audit report](https://sherlock-files.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/contest_data/report-cantinacode-usual-1007-phase1.pdf) shared in the [contest's README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1-xiaoming9090?tab=readme-ov-file#q-please-list-any-known-issues-and-explicitly-state-the-acceptable-risks-for-each-known-issue) (For Issue 3.2.2) 

> We've addressed point 1 by removing retroactive penalties, as setting penalties for past months was unnecessary. However, penalties for future months remain since we plan to apply them just before the next month starts and we do not want to restrict it further.

Clearly, from the above-mentioned points, it is not to allow a retroactive penalty against a user within the protocol.

However, as shown in the scenario earlier, it is possible for an operator to apply a penalty retroactively to the USUAL tokens that a user has already earned (those months that have already passed), leading to a loss of funds for the users.

### Impact

An operator applies a penalty retroactively to the USUAL tokens that a user has already earned, leading to a loss of funds for the users.

Severity: Medium. The issue causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states, or a loss is highly constrained

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider the following changes to the validation check to ensure that a penalty cannot be applied retroactively to the USUAL tokens that a user has already earned (those months that have already passed).

```diff
function setPenaltyPercentages(
    uint256[] memory penaltyPercentages,
    address[] memory accounts,
    uint256 month
) external {
    uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();

    // Validate the month is within the 6-month vesting period
-    if (month < monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) {
+    if (month =< monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) {
        revert OutOfBounds();
    }
```
