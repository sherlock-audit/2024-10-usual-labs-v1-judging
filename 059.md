# UsualX is not fully ERC4626 compliant


### Summary

UsualX.sol is not ERC4626 contrary to contract's documentation, which will lead to integration issues.

### Root Cause

Various functions in UsualX.sol do not follow the ERC4626 specification, breaking composibility. It also runs contrary to the protocol and external integrations expectation as from the [documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/README.md#L180), it is expected to be.

> The UsualX contract is an upgradeable ERC4626-compliant yield-bearing vault. It extends the YieldBearingVault contract, incorporating features such as whitelisting, blacklisting, withdrawal fees, and yield distribution linearly over a predefined yield period.

1. [`maxDeposit`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/723f8cab09cdae1aca9ec9cc1cfa040c2d4b06c1/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L154) doesn't return 0 when the vault is paused or the caller is blacklisted therefore does not factor in global and user-specific limits.

> MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if deposits are entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.

2. [`maxMint`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/723f8cab09cdae1aca9ec9cc1cfa040c2d4b06c1/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L159) same as `maxDeposit` doesn't factor that the vault can be pauesed and doesnt return 0.

> MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if mints are entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.

3. [`maxWithdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L413) doesn't factor in the fact that vault can be paused and doesn't return 0, when it is.

> MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if withdrawals are entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.

4. [`maxRedeem`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/723f8cab09cdae1aca9ec9cc1cfa040c2d4b06c1/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626Upgradeable.sol#L169) doesn't factor in the fact that vault can be paused and doesn't return 0, when it is.

> MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if redemption is entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.
