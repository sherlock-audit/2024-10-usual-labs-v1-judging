# Some rewards cannot be claimed due to blacklisted accounts

### Summary

Some rewards cannot be claimed due to blacklisted accounts.





### Root Cause

In [usualSP contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L260C1-L276C6), users can stake their usual tokens and they can get rewards from this between periods. However, if a user with stakes get blacklisted; neither the user are able to reach his tokens nor other users get enough of the rewards. Since the calculation of [reward per token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/modules/RewardAccrualBase.sol#L106C1-L127C6) is calculated through total stake money, it isn't counted for the blacklisted users. There are always a remaining tokens split in the total stake for the blacklisted users, making it unclaimable.

```solidity 

    function _rewardPerToken() internal view virtual returns (uint256 rewardPerToken) {
        RewardAccrualBaseStorageV0 storage $ = _getRewardAccrualBaseDataStorage();
        uint256 timeElapsed;
        // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
        if (totalStaked() == 0) {
            return $.rewardPerTokenStored;
        } else {
            if ($.periodFinish == 0) {
                timeElapsed = block.timestamp - $.lastUpdateTime;
            } else {
                uint256 end = Math.min(block.timestamp, $.periodFinish);
                if ($.lastUpdateTime < end) {
                    timeElapsed = end - $.lastUpdateTime;
                } else {
                    timeElapsed = 0;
                }
            }
            uint256 rewardIncrease = $.rewardRate * timeElapsed;
&>          rewardPerToken = $.rewardPerTokenStored
                + rewardIncrease.mulDiv(1e24, totalStaked(), Math.Rounding.Floor); // 1e6 for precision loss
        }
    }
```




### Internal pre-conditions

1. Blacklisted users should have some stake


### Attack Path

1.There are total of 100 rewards and 1000 stakes
2.Alice has 100 stakes
3.Alice is black-listed
4.Alice has already no access to her rewards. (acceptable)
5.Pool keep getting missing rewards.



### Impact

High-Everyone in the reward pool will get less reward than what they should've got. (Loss of funds)


### Mitigation

Distributed rewards of the blacklisted users to the legit users.
