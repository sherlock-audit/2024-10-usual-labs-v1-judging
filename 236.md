# The blacklisted user will still be eligible for reward and his reward will keep accumulating

### Summary

When a user is blacklisted by Usual, their staking rewards continue to accumulate, allowing them to claim all rewards from the start of their staking once they are unblacklisted. This behavior is unaddressed, as typically, when a user is blacklisted, their assets should be frozen, preventing any earnings until they are removed from the blacklist.


### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the lack of logic to halt reward accrual for blacklisted users. Currently, adding a user to the blacklist only prevents them from claiming rewards or unstaking assets, but their rewards continue to accumulate. This does not align with the standard practice, as the user can claim rewards for the period they were blacklisted once they are removed from the blacklist.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user has some assets stake in usual.


### External pre-conditions

1. User got blacklisted after staking.


### Attack Path

1. The User Stake `usualS` token. 
2. The user got blacklisted.
3. The rewards will continue to accumulate even when user is in blacklisted.
4. after a long time the got unBlacklisted.
5. The user will be able to claim all the reward from his staking time.


### Impact

A blacklisted user continues to accumulate rewards during their time on the blacklist, allowing them to claim the full amount of accrued rewards from their entire staking period once they are removed from the blacklist. This unintended accumulation undermines Blacklisting standard, as it effectively rewards blacklisted users despite their restricted status.


### PoC

For this to work as intended I have added `getReward` function in `UsualSp.sol`
```solidity
    function getRewards() external  returns(uint256) {
        RewardAccrualBaseStorageV0 storage $ = _getRewardAccrualBaseDataStorage();
        _updateReward(msg.sender);
        return $.rewards[msg.sender];
    }
```
The Test Case:
 
```solidity 

    function setupStartTwoDayRewardDistribution(uint256 amount) internal {
        deal(address(usualToken), address(distributionModule), amount);
        vm.startPrank(address(distributionModule));
        usualToken.approve(address(usualSP), amount);
        usualSP.startRewardDistribution(amount, block.timestamp, block.timestamp + 100 days); // 2 day
        vm.stopPrank();
    }


    function testStakeUsualS_RewardAccruedEvenWhenUserIsBlacklisted() public {
        skip(ONE_MONTH);
        uint256 rewardAmount = 20e18;
        setupStartTwoDayRewardDistribution(rewardAmount);
        uint256 amount = USUALS_TOTAL_SUPPLY / 2;
        deal(address(usualS), alice, amount);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        usualS.approve(address(usualSP), amount);
        usualSP.stake(amount);
        skip( 1 days);
        console.log("rewards before blackListing" , usualSP.getRewards());
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.prank(blacklistOperator);
        usualS.blacklist(alice);
        address[] memory recipientToRemove = new address[](1);
        recipientToRemove[0] = alice;
        vm.startPrank(usualSPOperator);
        usualSP.removeOriginalAllocation(recipientToRemove);

        skip( 100 days);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        console.log("rewards After blackListing" , usualSP.getRewards());
        setupStartTwoDayRewardDistribution(rewardAmount);
        skip( 100 days);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        console.log("rewards After blackListing" , usualSP.getRewards());
    }
```
Run Command : `forge test --mt testStakeUsualS_RewardAccruedEvenWhenUserIsBlacklisted -vvv`
Output:
```solidity
Logs:
  rewards before blackListing 66666666666643200
  rewards After blackListing 6666666666664320000
  rewards After blackListing 13333333333328640000
```


### Mitigation

Add a Mechanism to handle this case for blacklisted users.
