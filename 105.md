# `UsualSP::removeOriginalAllocation()` does not call `updateReward()` leading to the insider losing his earned and generated rewards.

### Summary

The missing call on `updateReward()` during the `removeOriginalAllocation` will cause the insider to lose his earned rewards since they will not be captured on his `rewards` mapping.

### Root Cause

In `UsualSP::removeOriginalAllocation()` there is a missing call on `updateRewards()` that will have unintended consequences on the insider his allocation is removed. The function may be `admin-only` but there is no other way for admin to access this functionality of the smart contracts (removing or **decreasing** the allocation of an insider by removing and then allocating again) so there is no way for this bug to be prevented. We can see the `UsualSP::removeOriginalAllocation()` implementation here :
```solidity
    function removeOriginalAllocation(address[] calldata recipients) external {
        if (recipients.length == 0) {
            revert InvalidInputArraysLength();
        }

        UsualSPStorageV0 storage $ = _usualSPStorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(USUALSP_OPERATOR_ROLE);

        for (uint256 i; i < recipients.length;) {
            $.originalAllocation[recipients[i]] = 0;
            $.originalClaimed[recipients[i]] = 0;

            emit RemovedOriginalAllocation(recipients[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

As we can see there is no call to `updateReward()` and as a result the generated rewards for the time that the insider was vested will be not be added on his `rewards` mapping in `RewardAccrualBase`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin to allocate to some insiders.
2. Admin wanting to remove or **decrease** this allocation for some insider and call `removeOriginalAllocation()`... the earned and generated rewards will be lost.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

No attack path, just regular usage of supported and expected functionalities.


### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that the rewards that the insider has been earned for the whole time that he had the allocation will be lost for ever. The problem is that `removeOriginalAllocation` can be also called if the allocation is needed to be **decreased** (the user will just remove and the `allocate` again). So, the lost rewards are a big problem cause they been actually generated for this specific insider.
