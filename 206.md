# UsualSP::_released() function may return less than the due amount, DOSing user claims of part of their due released funds

### Summary

UsualSP::_released() calculates how much of a user's originalAllocation is vested. It does so by calculating the released amount ratio as the ratio between passed months (since period start) to total duration months (36 months).  

However, a rounding bug in the calculation (see root cause for details) can cause the function to return the ratio as `(X-1) * amount / 36 ` instead of `X * amount / 36 ` even though more than X months have passed since period start. This results in users being unable to claim their full released amount, potentially up to the end of the full 36 months term. In other words, this problem may cause DOS of full released allocation claims.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that in [_released()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/4fb4a64a479e0b9b8f93934220e891c29d54df33/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L189), the months that have passed since the start time are calculated in two parts: 
1. First the months in the cliff period are calculated
2. Then the months between the end of the cliff and the current time are calculated
3. Then these months are added together.

as can be seen in the code:
```solidity
 uint256 totalMonthsInCliffDuration = insiderCliffDuration / ONE_MONTH;

.
.
.
uint256 monthsPassed =
        (block.timestamp - $.startDate - insiderCliffDuration) / ONE_MONTH;

    // Calculate the vested amount based on the number of months passed
    uint256 vestedAmount = totalAllocation.mulDiv(
        totalMonthsInCliffDuration + monthsPassed,
        NUMBER_OF_MONTHS_IN_THREE_YEARS,
        Math.Rounding.Floor
    );
```

The problem is that each of the first two steps of calculation can round down up to a month. If Both calculations together round down more than a month, the resulting months-since-start will be one less than the actual result.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user cliff duration is not an exact multiple of a whole month (there is a leftover that is rounded down) 

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Note: calculations in the example are done is days instead of seconds for simplicity  

1. A user with a total allocation of 36000 UsualS calls claimOriginalAllocation
2. the user cliff is 59 days
3. At the time of the call, is has been 60 days since the start
4. As per the code above, the users months will be calculated as: (insiderCliffDuration / ONE_MONTH) + (block.timestamp - $.startDate - insiderCliffDuration) / ONE_MONTH. or 59 / 30  + 1 / 30 = 1 (rounded down) + 01 (rounded down) = 1
5. As a result, the vested amount returned is 1 * 36000 / 36 = 1000.
6. If the calculation was done in one go (60/30) the result would be the correct 2 months, and the returned vested amount would be 2 * 36000 / 36 = 2000.
7. Note that this error will continue until day 89 (where the current code  calculation gives the correct result) making this a DOS on claiming half of the user's true released amount (1000 out of 2000) for at least 29 days.


### Impact

Dos on claiming part of the currently vested allocation (in the above example, half the vested amount for 29 days at least)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In _released() calculate the total months passed in one operation: (block.timestamp - $.startDate) / ONE_MONTH
