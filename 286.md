# Collateral Tokens with >18 decimals can cause zero value minted to user

### Summary


In the `swap` function, we see that an amount of collateral token is transferred to the treasury and the equivalent value in decimals 18 is minted to the user.

For a collateral token of > 18 decimals with small amount swapped, zero value will be minted to user which would be reverted by USD0 and cause DOS to users using that exact collateral within an amount range of (0 - 10**(col decimal - 18))

An example is YAMv2 with 24 decimals means 1-1,000,000 value of collateral will always be reverted and DOS'ed

### Root Cause

The swap function calls the function at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L499

This is where the collateral amount is converted to decimal 18

The division at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/utils/normalize.sol#L16 will return zero for low amount of high decimal collateral tokens
