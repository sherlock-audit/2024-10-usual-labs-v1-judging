# Admin will cause freezing much of rewards for stakers to protocol.

### Summary

Wrong implementation of `UsualSP.sol#totalStaked()` will cause freezing much of rewards for stakers to protocol as the admin will call `stakeUsualS() => usualS.stakeAll()`.

### Root Cause

- In `UsualSP.sol#totalStaked()`, it considers full balance of this contract to be staked to claim rewards.   
  But funds staked through `stakeUsualS()` cannot be used to claim rewards but `rewardPerToken` is calculated with these funds.

### Impact

The protocol suffers freezing rewards by funds staked through `stakeUsualS()`.

### PoC

- A user deposits 100e18.
- The admin calls `stakeUsualS()` for allocating funds to users.
  Then, 100e18 is staked through this course.
  So `totalStaked()` becomes `200e18`.
- `RewardAccrualBase.sol#_updateDistribution()` is called by some reason.
  Then, we say that rewards in `RewardAccrualBase.sol#_rewardPerToken()` are 10e18.
- Then, `rewardPerToken` is increased as `10e18 / 200e18 = 0.05`.
  But half of this is freezed because it is for funds staked through `stakeUsualS()` and they does not contain any user's balance.


### Mitigation

We have to modify logic tracking funds to be used for rewards so that `totalStaked()` returns that amount.
