# Lack of Input Validation in AirdropTaxCollector.sol

### Summary

I have identified vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, particularly within the setter functions `setMaxChargeableTax` and `setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances`. These functions lack sufficient validation of input parameters before updating the contract's state variables. Specifically, `setMaxChargeableTax` does not ensure the `tax` value falls within a meaningful range beyond being non-zero and not exceeding the `BASIS_POINT_BASE`, while `setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances` only checks that the arrays have matching lengths, but does not validate the individual values in the `prelaunchBalances` array. This oversight can result in unintended consequences or exploitation if malicious or invalid data is passed.

### Root Cause

1. **`setMaxChargeableTax` function**:  
   While the function checks that `tax` is not zero and does not exceed the `BASIS_POINT_BASE`, it fails to check if `tax` falls within an acceptable range. For example, there may be a valid upper threshold for the `tax` value that is not enforced by the current implementation.

2. **`setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances` function**:  
   The function validates that the lengths of `addressesToAllocateTo` and `prelaunchBalances` match, but it does not ensure that the values within `prelaunchBalances` are non-zero, valid, or within an expected range. Without this validation, users can potentially set invalid or malicious data, such as zero balances, which could affect the contract's tax calculation logic.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The `setMaxChargeableTax` function assumes that the `tax` value passed is within a valid range. However, it only checks that it is greater than zero and less than or equal to `BASIS_POINT_BASE`.
- The `setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances` function assumes that the arrays `addressesToAllocateTo` and `prelaunchBalances` are non-empty and have matching lengths, but it does not validate the individual elements of the `prelaunchBalances` array.

### External pre-conditions

- The contract relies on specific roles, such as `AIRDROP_OPERATOR_ROLE`, for executing these functions.
- The integrity of external data is assumed, with the contract trusting the lengths of arrays and non-zero balances provided by users.

### Attack Path

1. **Deploy the vulnerable contract**:  
   Deploy the contract with the vulnerable `setMaxChargeableTax` and `setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances` functions on a test network or local environment.

2. **Exploit `setMaxChargeableTax`**:  
   An attacker with the `AIRDROP_OPERATOR_ROLE` can call `setMaxChargeableTax` with a value that is technically valid (non-zero and less than `BASIS_POINT_BASE`), but falls outside the acceptable tax range for the contract's business logic. This could lead to unintended tax calculations.

3. **Exploit `setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances`**:  
   An attacker with the with the `AIRDROP_OPERATOR_ROLE`can invoke `setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances` with arrays where `prelaunchBalances[i]` contains zero or malicious values, potentially disrupting the contract's tax calculation logic or causing other unintended consequences.

### Impact

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could result in:
- **Inaccurate tax calculations**: The `maxChargeableTax` could be set to an inappropriate value, impacting the calculation of taxes during the airdrop.
- **Disruption of airdrop mechanics**: Invalid or zero prelaunch balances could compromise the contract's tax calculations, affecting eligible claimers and possibly resulting in unexpected behavior.
- **State corruption**: Accepting invalid inputs could lead to incorrect contract state, potentially manipulating or disrupting the tax collection process.

### PoC

The following Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates an attack where an adversary can exploit the unchecked setter functions:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity 0.8.20;

import "./AirdropTaxCollector.sol";

contract AttackAirdropTaxCollector {
    AirdropTaxCollector public airdropTaxCollector;
    address[] public maliciousAddresses;
    uint256[] public maliciousBalances;

    constructor(address _airdropTaxCollectorAddress) {
        airdropTaxCollector = AirdropTaxCollector(_airdropTaxCollectorAddress);
    }

    function attackSetMaxChargeableTax() public {
        uint256 maliciousTax = 100000; // Arbitrary value exceeding typical tax ranges
        airdropTaxCollector.setMaxChargeableTax(maliciousTax);
    }

    function attackSetUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances() public {
        maliciousAddresses.push(address(this));
        maliciousBalances.push(0); // Zero balance, which should not be allowed

        airdropTaxCollector.setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances(maliciousAddresses, maliciousBalances);
    }
}
```

This PoC can be adapted to various testing frameworks such as Foundry, Hardhat, Truffle, or Brownie for exploitation, demonstration, and validation.

### Mitigation

To address these issues, I recommend adding robust input validation checks in the affected functions:

#### Patched Code
```solidity
function setMaxChargeableTax(uint256 tax) external {
    require(tax != 0, "Tax cannot be zero");
    require(tax <= BASIS_POINT_BASE, "Tax exceeds maximum limit");
    require(tax <= 5000, "Tax exceeds acceptable range"); // Example threshold

    AirdropTaxCollectorStorage storage $ = _airdropTaxCollectorStorage();
    $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(AIRDROP_OPERATOR_ROLE);

    if ($.maxChargeableTax == tax) {
        revert SameValue();
    }

    $.maxChargeableTax = tax;
    emit MaxChargeableTaxSet(tax);
}

function setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances(
    address[] calldata addressesToAllocateTo,
    uint256[] calldata prelaunchBalances
) external whenNotPaused {
    AirdropTaxCollectorStorage storage $ = _airdropTaxCollectorStorage();
    $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(AIRDROP_OPERATOR_ROLE);

    require(addressesToAllocateTo.length == prelaunchBalances.length, "Array lengths must match");

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < addressesToAllocateTo.length; i++) {
        require(prelaunchBalances[i] > 0, "Balance cannot be zero");
        require(prelaunchBalances[i] <= BASIS_POINT_BASE, "Balance exceeds acceptable range");
        $.prelaunchUsd0ppBalance[addressesToAllocateTo[i]] = prelaunchBalances[i];
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of the Fix
- **`setMaxChargeableTax`**: Ensures `tax` is not zero, does not exceed the `BASIS_POINT_BASE`, and falls within a reasonable upper threshold (e.g., 5000 basis points).
- **`setUsd0ppPrelaunchBalances`**: Checks that `prelaunchBalances[i]` is greater than zero and within the `BASIS_POINT_BASE` range, ensuring valid data is set.

### **Conclusion**
By implementing these input validation checks, the smart contract will be protected from potential exploits related to invalid tax values and prelaunch balances. This will enhance the contract's stability and security, reducing the risk of malicious manipulation and ensuring that only valid data is accepted.
