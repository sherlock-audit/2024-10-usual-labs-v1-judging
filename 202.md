# Users can deposit to `UsualX` when it is paused

### Summary

In the `UsualX` there is a functionality for pausing. This contract is extending `YieldBearingVault`, which from his side is extending the `ERC4626Upgradeable`. Three of the functions in the `UsualX` can be used only if the contract is not paused and to be more precisely: `depositWithPermit`, `redeem` and `withdraw`(the last two ovverrides the original functions from the `ERC4626Upgradeable`). But the problem is that `ERC4626Upgradeable` have two more functions that modifies the state `deposit` and `mint`, both of these function are not overrided and still can modify the state even if the contract is paused.  

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that while `UsualX` inherits from `YieldBearingVault`, which in turn inherits from `ERC4626Upgradeable`, only specific functions (`depositWithPermit`, `redeem`, and `withdraw`) in `UsualX` are protected by a pause check. The `ERC4626Upgradeable` contract includes two additional functions, `deposit` and `mint`, which modify the contract's state. However, these functions are not overridden in `UsualX` to incorporate the pause functionality, meaning they remain unprotected. As a result, these unprotected functions can be executed and modify the contract’s state even if `UsualX` is paused.

### Impact

This oversight introduces a significant risk in the contract’s pause functionality, as users can still interact with the contract in ways that alter its state when it is supposed to be paused. Specifically, users can still call `deposit` and `mint` to add funds or issue new shares, which could potentially lead to unintended or unauthorized asset transfers, fund minting, and other state changes during a pause.

### Mitigation

Override the methods in the `UsualX` of `ERC4626Upgradeable`: `deposit` and `mint` and add to their function structure a modifier.
