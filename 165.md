# Potential Front-Running Vulnerability in `activateCBR(uint256 coefficient)` affecting the `DaoCollateral` protocol.

### Summary

The `activateCBR(....)` function :: `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L340`  is vulnerable to front-running, allowing a malicious actor to execute redemption(`redeem(....)`) and swap (`swap(...)` , `swapRWAtoStbc(.....)` , `swapRWAtoStbcIntent(....)`) operations right before CBR activation, which imposes restrictions. By calling redeem before CBR is active, the attacker can avoid a reduction in rwaToken returns, and by executing swaps ahead of CBR, they benefit from conditions that would otherwise be paused or limited. This exploit undermines the protocol’s intended CBR safeguards, allowing the attacker to secure better rates or liquidity, potentially draining assets and impacting legitimate users and the protocol’s stability.

### Root Cause

In `DaoCollateral.sol:340`, the absence of an immediate enforcement mechanism for activating CBR allows the activateCBR function to be front-run, resulting in calls to redeem and swap functions under conditions that avoid the restrictions intended by CBR activation.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` sees a situation to active CBR and calls `activateCBR(...)` function.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.A malicious actor identifies that the activateCBR function will soon be executed by an authorized account to set the cbrCoef and activate the CBR (Counter Bank Run) mechanism. This activation will restrict certain swap and redeem functions, making them unavailable or less profitable once CBR is active.
2.The malicious actor prepares transactions to call redeem or swap functions (redeem, swap, swapRWAtoStbc, and swapRWAtoStbcIntent) that will provide maximum benefit before CBR restricts them.The attacker submits these transactions with a higher gas fee, prioritizing them to be mined before the activateCBR transaction.
3.If the attacker’s transactions are mined before activateCBR, they proceed with redeeming or swapping without the CBR restriction, securing more favorable outcomes. For example, calling redeem before CBR enables a higher amount of rwaToken return, while calling swap functions allows swaps that CBR would prevent.

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of potential control over token liquidity distribution during critical moments due to delayed CBR activation. The attacker gains the ability to bypass intended restrictions, claiming a higher quantity of rwaToken upon redeeming and completing swaps that would otherwise be disallowed, thus exploiting the system for personal gain before the mechanism takes effect.
