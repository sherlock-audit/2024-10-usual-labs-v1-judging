### Mitigation

It is recommended that the [_latestRoundData function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/oracles/UsualOracle.sol#L97) implement a validation check comparing the timestamp returned by the oracle with the timeout stored in the [TokenOracle struct](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/oracles/AbstractOracle.sol#L30-L36). This will ensure that only fresh and valid data is utilized in crucial functionalities such as SWAP and REDEEM
