# Incorrect withdraw fee calculation in withdraw

### Summary

The final withdraw fee's calculation is incorrect. This will cause share's price increase after this withdrawal.

### Root Cause

In [UsualX:336](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/vaults/UsualX.sol#L336), when users want to withdraw their Usual token, they need to pay some withdraw fee. But the problem is that the final withdraw fee's calculation is incorrect.
In withdraw(), we will make use of `Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil)` to calculate the withdraw fee. Here the `assets` means actual withdraw Usual token amount, not the whole deduct Usual token amount in this withdraw.

For example:
1. Alice has 100 shares. Assume share's price is 1:1 with Usual asset.
2. `withdrawFeeBps` is 25%. This means that Alice can only withdraw 75 asset from this Vault. Because the left 25 will become the withdraw fee.
3. When Alice withdraw her Usual asset via `withdraw`(assets = 75), all of her shares will be burned and transfer 75 Usual to Alice.
4. When we try to calculate the withdraw fee, the withdraw fee is `75 * 2500/10_000 = 18.75`. But the actual withdraw fee should be 25.
5. This will cause that `yieldStorage.totalDeposits` will be larger than expected. Share's price will increase because of this wrong withdrawal fee calculation.

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
        public
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        ...
        shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
@>        uint256 fee = Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

        super._withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, assets, shares);

        // take the fee
        yieldStorage.totalDeposits -= fee;
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. Alice has 100 shares. Assume share's price is 1:1 with Usual asset.
2. `withdrawFeeBps` is 25%. This means that Alice can only withdraw 75 asset from this Vault. Because the left 25 will become the withdraw fee.
3. When Alice withdraw her Usual asset via `withdraw`(assets = 75), all of her shares will be burned and transfer 75 Usual to Alice.
4. When we try to calculate the withdraw fee, the withdraw fee is `75 * 2500/10_000 = 18.75`. But the actual withdraw fee should be 25.
5. This will cause that `yieldStorage.totalDeposits` will be larger than expected. Share's price will increase because of this wrong withdrawal fee calculation.

### Impact

1. Share's price will increase when someone withdraws Usual.
2. The latter withdrawer can withdraw funds with one higher share price.
3. When funds are not enough in the Vault, the left users cannot withdraw their funds.

### Mitigation

`Math.mulDiv(assets, $.withdrawFeeBps, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Ceil);`. This formula can work well on condition that the `assets` should be withdrawal amount without fee, not the withdraw amount after the fee deduction.
