# Penalty will be miscalculate after improper setting `penaltyPercentageByMonth`.

##Summary
Penalty will be miscalculate after improper setting `penaltyPercentageByMonth`.

##Vulnerability Detail
If an account who is `Top80` and has not paid tax claims airdrop allocation, then `penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month]` will be set to zero after calculation of penalty, and if an account who is `Top80` and has paid tax claims airdrop allocation, then `penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month]` and `penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month+1]` will be set to zero.
Then if an account who has `AIRDROP_PENALTY_OPERATOR_ROLE` role could set `penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month]` and `penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month+1]` with nonzero value via `setPenaltyPercentages` function.
After that account who is Top80 could reclaim and the penalty will be calculte with `penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month]` and `penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month+1]` .
As a result, `penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month]` and `penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month+1]` are contribute to penalty again.

##Impact

In `AirdropDistribution.sol`, we are calling [PrepareProposalHandler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L336)

```solidity
function claim(address account, bool isTop80, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
    {
       [...]

        (uint256 amountToClaim, uint256 penaltyAmount) = _available($, account, amount, isTop80);//audit line
       [...]

    }
```

And `_available` function calls `_computePenalty` and `$.penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][i]` is set to zero after calculation of penalty.
But in function `setPenaltyPercentages`, [PrepareProposalHandler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/airdrop/AirdropDistribution.sol#L371)  accepts month that is in [monthsPassed, AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS].

```solidity
function setPenaltyPercentages(
        uint256[] memory penaltyPercentages,
        address[] memory accounts,
        uint256 month
    ) external {
        uint256 monthsPassed = _calculateMonthsPassed();

        // Validate the month is within the 6-month vesting period
        if (month < monthsPassed || month > AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS) {//audit line
            revert OutOfBounds();
        }

        [...]
    }
```

And `penaltyPercentageByMonth[account][month]` will be set to nonzero value.
And the account who is Top80 could reclaim and the penalty will be miscalculate.

##Tool used
Manual Review

##Recommendation

Please add a map variable `lastClaimedMonth[account]` and set Percentage for every account and accept month for  [lastClaimedMonth[account], AIRDROP_VESTING_DURATION_IN_MONTHS]
