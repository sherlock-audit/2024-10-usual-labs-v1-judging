# Can Reduce UsualS Allocation by Removing then Re-Adding Allocation

### Summary

Although there is protection against reducing the original allocation in `allocate`, allocation is still able to be reduced by calling `removeOriginalAllocation` then calling `allocate` again. This breaks the intent of the contract.

Doing this also resets originalClaimedAmount which can cause further problems.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L367 this function has no checks to make sure allocate can't then be called again after https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-usual-labs-v1/blob/main/pegasus/packages/solidity/src/token/UsualSP.sol#L327

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin sets original allocation
2. Admin removes original allocation
3. Admin adds original allocation back

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets original allocation
2. Admin removes original allocation
3. Admin adds original allocation back

### Impact

This allows reducing of an allocation. It shouldn't cause much harm to the contract, but breaks its intentions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When allocation is removed, add a check to ensure it can't be re-added.
